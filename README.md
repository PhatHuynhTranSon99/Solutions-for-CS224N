# Code solution for CS224N: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning

## About
This repository contains all the code solutions that I have created for Standfordd CS224N course. This is just for personal record and by no mean a guide for others to follow. With that being said, I have people find some inspiration in this repo for solving the exercises themselves.

## Assignment list
- [ ] Assignment 1: Word embedding overview
- [ ] Assignment 2: Word2Vec implementation (using negative sampling)
- [ ] Assignment 3: Neural Dependency parsing 
- [ ] Assignment 4: To Be Addded
- [ ] Assignment 5: To Be Added

## Notes
In next steps, I hope to finish all these assigments and perhaps complete and update all the written solutions in PDF form.
