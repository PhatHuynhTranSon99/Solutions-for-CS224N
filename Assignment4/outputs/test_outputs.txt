You know that what I do is write for kids, and, in fact, I'm probably the author for kids, most in the U.S.
And I always tell people I don't want to seem like a scientist.
I can <unk> like farmer, or with leather clothes, and you never have chosen a farmer.
I'm here today to talk to you about circles and <unk>
And you know that a <unk> is usually something that fell in some place.
You just have to turn the apple back to see it as a <unk>
That's the paint of a circle.
A friend of mine did that -- Richard <unk>
It's the kind of complicated circle of which I'm going to talk about.
My circle started in the <unk> in the middle school, in the middle school, in <unk> Ohio where I was the rare class.
When I was beaten up to bleed every week in the <unk> of the boys, until a teacher saved my life.
She saved my life in my life to go into the bathroom house.
I did it in secret, it.
For three years.
And I had to go from the city.
He had a thumb, and 85 dollars, and I ended up in San Francisco, California -- I found a lover -- and in the <unk> I felt the need to start working in organizations that were fighting against AIDS.
About three or four years ago, half of the night I got a phone call from that <unk> the <unk> lady who said, "I need to see you.
I'm <unk> that we have never got to know us.
You could go to Ohio -- and please bring that guy that I know you've found.
And I have to tell you I have pancreatic cancer, and I'd like you to tell you about please."
Well, the next day we were in <unk>
And we went to see it, we got <unk> and we realized that she needed to be <unk>
We found a place, the <unk> and we take care of her family, because it was necessary,
It's something we knew how to do.
And as the woman who wanted to <unk> as an adult came to <unk> became a box of ashes and it was put in my hands.
And what happened was the circle was closed, it had become a circle -- and that epiphany that I told you about it was done in itself.
<unk> is that death is part of life.
She saved my life, my partner and I save the her.
And you know that that part of life needs everything that the rest of life.
It needs truth and beauty, and I'm very happy that today talked a lot about this.
It also needs -- needs dignity, love and pleasure. And it's our work to provide those things.
Thank you.
As an artist, the connection is very important to me.
Through my work, I'm trying to express that humans are not separated from nature and that everything is interconnected.
I was for the first time to Antarctica almost 10 years ago, and I saw my first <unk>
I was <unk>
My heart can quickly, I was trying to understand what was in front of me.
I went around the <unk> of the water almost 60 feet -- and I couldn't even think that it was a <unk> on another <unk> a year after a year.
<unk> are born when we fall from the glaciers or you break the barriers into ice.
Every single iceberg has its own individual personality.
They have a different way of interacting with their environment and their experiences.
Some people refuse to give up and hold up to the end, while other people can't afford it, more and <unk> in a <unk> passion <unk>
It's easy to think, when you see a <unk> that are isolated apart and themselves, as much as we see us sometimes as humans.
But the reality is the opposite.
As a <unk> is <unk> I'm breathing its <unk> atmosphere.
As a eardrum is melts a B15 water releases rich in minerals that feeds many forms of life.
I walk up to photograph these <unk> as if it was all of the portraits of my ancestors -- knowing that in these unique moments there are in that way, and will not come back to there and not exist.
It's not death when you get sick, it's not an end, but a continuation of its way for the cycle of life.
Part of the ice of the <unk> that photograph is very <unk> it has a couple thousand years.
And another part of the ice is over 100 years old.
The last few pictures I'd like to show you is from a iceberg that I photographed in <unk> Greenland.
It's gradually going to be really going to see a iceberg in it.
Here it is.
You can see on the left a little boat.
It's about five meters.
And I would like to pay attention to the shape of the iceberg and your <unk> line.
You can see here, it starts to <unk> the ship has moved to the other side and the man is standing there.
This is one of the average volume of average.
<unk> from the water about 120 feet or 40 feet.
This video is in real time.
And so let's go through the iceberg a different side of your personality.
Thank you.
I want you to imagine two partners in 1979, the same day, exactly at the same time, every single <unk>
So two couples every one with a baby.
I don't want you to stand too much in the details of conception, because if you stop thinking about conception.
Let's think about that for a moment.
And on this stage I want you to imagine that, in one case, the sperm and sperm joins the X <unk>
And in the other case, the sperm X <unk> joins the X <unk>
They're both <unk> and it starts life.
We'll go back to talk about them later.
In my <unk> activity to play two roles.
One of my roles work with the history of anatomy.
I'm a <unk> and what I study in this case is the way people started to find out the anatomy -- that is, of human bodies and <unk> how they have considered the body fluids the idea of the <unk> what have you thought about the body.
The other role in my work is an activist, like a <unk> of patients or, as I say sometimes, <unk> <unk> people who are medical patients.
In this case, I've worked with people whose physical characteristics defy social norms.
I've been working on, for example, with fraternal twins -- two people inside a body.
I've worked with people with <unk> people much lower than the average.
And I've worked with many cases of people with <unk> sex, individuals whose physical <unk> doesn't fit into male <unk> and conventional <unk>
In general, we can make it <unk> <unk>
<unk> has many forms.
I'm going to give you some examples of ways of having a sex that doesn't fit in the common or a female <unk>
For example, this is the case of the individual with <unk> <unk> which is the <unk> gene -- and it tells the <unk> that we all have in the <unk> life that they become <unk>
And then, in life -- the testicles are making testosterone.
But given that this individual lacks <unk> the body doesn't react to the same.
It's <unk> <unk>
So, there's high testosterone levels of testosterone but <unk>
As a consequence, the body develops in a typical course.
When you look at the baby it looks like a little girl.
It's a girl, it's raised as a child.
And often, it's not until puberty, when it's growing and developing the breast region, but it doesn't have the menstrual period, when someone realizes something is happening.
And after doing examinations you realize that instead of having <unk> and <unk> actually has testicles and <unk>
The important thing to understand is that you can think that this is a man, but it's not really like that.
Women like men, we have in the body something called <unk> <unk>
They're in the back of the body.
<unk> glands produce <unk> the <unk> hormone.
Most women like me -- I consider a <unk> woman who is not known to be a typical woman -- most women like me are sensitive to the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we respond to <unk>
As a consequence, somebody like me has the most exposed brain to the <unk> that the woman who was born with testicles that has <unk>
So sex is a complicated thing. It's not that <unk> are in the middle of the <unk> in some way they can be everywhere.
Another example: a few years ago I got a call from a 19 year-old <unk> who was born and raised as <unk> he had a <unk> and sex relationships with her, he was wearing a life as a boy, and I had just found that he had and <unk>
It had an extreme way of a disease known as <unk> <unk> <unk>
He had the 20th chromosomes and the uterus <unk> were so active that they were essentially created by a <unk> environment.
As a result, the genitals were <unk> their brain was exposed to the hormone component typically the male component.
He was born with <unk> nobody <unk> nothing.
And it was at the age of 19 years when she started having medical problems caused by the internal <unk> when doctors discovered that, in fact, was a woman inside.
Well, another quick example of a case of <unk>
Some people with Western chromosomes develop what's known as <unk> to say, they have tissue <unk> wrapped up in <unk>
We don't know why that happens.
So there's a lot of varieties of sex.
The reason that kids with this kind of bodies -- that are <unk> twins -- or <unk> are they <unk> it is not to be able to get rid of a better physical health.
In many cases people are perfectly healthy.
The reason they do it for various surgeries is that they are a threat to our social categories.
The system is usually based on the idea that a particular anatomy brings out a particular identity.
We have the idea that being woman is to be <unk> <unk> <unk> being black means to have African anatomy, in terms of <unk>
A terribly simplistic idea.
And when you have a body that shows something quite different, we have problems with <unk>
So we have very <unk> ideas in our culture with the <unk>
Our nation is based on a concept of the very romantic.
So imagine the amazing thing that is having children who are born like two people within a same body.
The most peak case is last year with the African African <unk> <unk> <unk> was put in the cloth.
A lot of reporters were called to ask, "What a test are you going to do to determine whether <unk> <unk> is a man or <unk>
And I had to tell the journalists that there is no such test.
In fact, we know that sex is so complicated that the sex is so complicated that we have to admit that nature doesn't traces a <unk> line between men and women and women and women and <unk> and women and <unk> are we who make that line.
So what we have is a situation where the more science, the more we need to admit that these categories -- a stable categories that are going directly into <unk> categories that are much more <unk> than they are <unk>
And not just in terms of sex.
Also in terms of race -- something that turns out much more complicated than what terminology is.
As we see, we get into a rough terrain.
<unk> for example, the fact that we share at least 95 percent of the DNA with chimpanzees.
What about the fact of <unk> of them in just a few <unk>
And as we <unk> in science, we get more and more in a uncomfortable zone where we have to recognize that the <unk> categories that are probably too <unk>
And we're looking at this in all walks of human life.
One of them, for example, in our current culture, in the United States today, are the struggles of the beginning and in order of life.
It's hard to set up a moment from which a body becomes human and it has rights to the <unk>
There are very <unk> discussions today -- not in public, but I know within the <unk> of when someone is considered dead.
Our ancestors never had to deal with this question of whether someone was dead.
As a lot of you put a pen in front of the nose, and if it was still not <unk>
If you stopped moving the <unk>
But today we can, for example, extract vital organs of a body and put it into another body.
And as a consequence, we have to deal with the dilemma of determining the prisoner's death, and this puts us in a difficult situation where we don't have the simple categories of the past.
And maybe think that this explosion of categories might be happy to someone like me.
In politics I'm a progressive, and <unk> people with unusual bodies but I have to admit that it gets me up there.
It turns out that these categories are much more fragile than what we thought we thought about.
So let's go from the point of view of democracy.
And to tell you about this tension first I have to admit, I'm a fervent fan of the <unk> <unk>
I know they were <unk> I know they were <unk> but they were big.
I mean, they were so brave and bold and so radical and so radical in what they did, that I find that music <unk> <unk> and not for music, which is totally <unk>
It's what happened in <unk> with the <unk> <unk>
The <unk> <unk> -- the first activists of the anatomy and explain why.
What they <unk> was a concept of <unk> and <unk> with another which was radical and beautiful and stayed for 200 years.
And, like everyone remember, what we <unk> our <unk> <unk> was the idea of <unk> <unk> was based on a very simplistic concept of anatomy.
The monarchs in the old world didn't know the DNA, but they had clear the right idea of birth.
They had the concept of blue blood.
They were from the idea that the political power came into the right of blood passed from the grandfather to the father and then to son, etc.
<unk> <unk> rejected that idea and replaced by a new concept of <unk> and that concept was that all men are created equal.
They went through the game field, and they decided that the anatomy that mattered was the anatomy in common and not <unk>
And in part they were doing it because they are part of a <unk> system, where they were <unk> two things.
It was <unk> democracy and at the same time <unk> science.
And it is very clear, if you look at the story of the <unk> <unk> that many were very interested in science and the idea of a <unk> world.
They were <unk> of the <unk> explanations and therefore <unk> the concept of power to be passed on from a vague <unk>
They were moving into a <unk> concept.
And if you look, for example, the Declaration of <unk> talk about nature and the god of nature.
They don't talk about God and the nature of God.
They talk about the power of nature to tell us who we are.
And as a result, they were passing the idea of <unk> <unk>
And in doing so, they were laid the foundations of the future <unk> movement.
They didn't think about it, but they did it for us and it was great.
And what happened next?
And women are <unk>
Then the success of the Civil Rights Movement with people from the <unk> <unk> who said, "I'm not a <unk>
We found men in the rows of the Civil Rights movement saying, "I'm a man.
And again, people in color that are <unk> to the <unk> <unk> and again, <unk>
We see the same with the <unk> movement.
The problem is, of course, as we look at the <unk> we have to start asking ourselves why we keep certain <unk>
But focus I want to keep some <unk> <unk> in our culture.
For example, I don't want to give you a fish the same rights to a human.
I don't want to tell you that we had to focus on anatomy.
I don't want to say that at the age of five years they had to allow sex or get married.
There are some <unk> <unk> that for me make sense, and I think we should be <unk>
But the challenge is to try to figure out what they are, why keep them keep them and if they make sense.
Well, let's go back to those two sentient beings at the beginning of this talk.
We have two <unk> both <unk> in the <unk> in exactly the same day.
Imagine that one of them, Mary, was born three months before I time: June 1, 1980.
Henry, on the contrary, was born in term: <unk> was born.
For the only fact that Mary was born three months before Mary was attributed to all the rights.
Henry has to wait for all of that not because it has a different age, but because it was born later.
We find other <unk> in relation to their rights.
Henry, by virtue of being considered a man -- if I haven't told you if it's <unk> by virtue of being considered a man now is <unk> from the compulsory <unk> that Mary doesn't have to worry.
Mary, on his hand, has no same rights to marriage that Henry in all states, for example.
Henry can marry all states with a woman, but Mary can marry one woman with only some states.
So we still do <unk> categories that in various aspects are <unk> and <unk>
And now the question is, what do we do now that science went both in the field of anatomy that we get to the point of having to admit that a democracy based on the anatomy could be <unk>
I don't want to give up the science, but at the same time, sometimes I feel like science <unk>
Where are we <unk>
It seems like what happens in our culture is a kind of <unk> attitude -- "Well, we need to trace the line somewhere, so we're going to do."
But a lot of people keep stuck in a strange position.
For example, Texas at some point has decided that to marry a man without the <unk> and to get married with a woman you have to have chromosome.
Now, in practice they don't make tests with people <unk>
But this is also very strange to the story that I told you at the beginning of the <unk> syndrome to the <unk>
If we look at one of the founding parents of modern democracy, Dr. Martin Luther King, in his speech, "I love <unk> offers a solution.
It says that we should judge people in the color of their skin, not in the color of their skin, but in the contents of their <unk> going beyond anatomy.
And I want to say, "Yeah, the idea looks pretty good one."
But in practice, what do you do?
How do people judge people based on their <unk>
I want to point out also that I'm not sure that I'm not sure that I should be able to do that to make rights to people, because I've got to admit that I know of some <unk> <unk> who probably deserve more social services than some humans I know.
I also want to say that maybe some of the <unk> that I know can make more choices and smart choices about their sexual relationships than people who know.
So how do you put the theme of the content of <unk>
It's very hard.
And a part of me asks what would happen if the character of a person could be measured with an instrument, perhaps with an MRI <unk>
Do we really want to get at that point?
I'm not sure where we go.
What I know is that it seems to be very important that the United States is still going to lead this current thinking of thinking about the issue of democracy.
We've done a good job in defense of democracy and I think we're going to do a good job in the future.
We don't live, for example, in a context like the Iranian that a man who feels attracted to other men is susceptible to being killed, unless they are willing to engage a change of sex, in which case it allows you to live.
We're not in that situation.
I'm glad to say that we don't have a context like the one of a surgeon that I talked about a couple of years ago that I had made to give birth twins and then pick them apart and get their <unk>
But when the phone asked him the reason for the <unk> <unk> a very <unk> operation, said that in that other country these kids would be very <unk> and therefore I had to do it.
What I said, "Well, it's considered the political asylum rather than the separation of separation <unk>
The United States offers huge possibilities to people who are <unk> to change for the good of the state.
So I think we need to be on the head.
Well, to finish up I mean I've been talking a lot about <unk>
And I want to think about what the democracy would be, or as I could have been, if we had given more involvement to the <unk>
And I want to tell you something a little radical for a feminist, and it's that I think there may be different ideas from different <unk> <unk> in particular if there are people thinking about them.
Since years ago, since I've been interested in the <unk> I've also been interested in researching the sex difference.
And one of the things that have been interested in is the differences between men and women in the way to think and operate in the world.
And what we know about <unk> studies is that women, on average, -- not all, but in <unk> tend to pay more attention to complex social relationships and to care about those who are <unk> inside the group.
And if we think about that, we have an interesting situation in our hands.
years ago, when I was in graduate school, one of my advisers who knew I was interested in feminism <unk> I was considered <unk> as <unk> made me a <unk>
<unk> what about feminine <unk>
And I thought, "It's the most stupid question I've heard.
Feminism has to do with getting rid of your gender, so there's nothing feminine in the <unk>
But the more I thought about his question, more than there is something about the <unk>
I mean, there might be something, on average, something different between the female and the male that makes us more <unk> to complex social relationships and willing to help the most vulnerable.
So if the <unk> were very attentive to find the way to protect the people in the state of the state, you may be able to have gotten more <unk> to this concept, maybe we would have enriched the concept of protection with the <unk>
And maybe that's what we need to do in the future when we make democracy beyond <unk> thinking less about the individual body, in terms of identity, and thinking more about relationships.
So as we try to create a more perfect <unk> think about what we do for each other.
Thank you.
In 2007, I decided we had to rethink how we think about economic development.
Our new goal should be that when every family thinks where they want to go to live and work, have the possibility of choosing between at least a handful of different cities that are competing to attract new residents of residents.
Well, at this point, we are far away from that goal.
There are billions of people in developing countries that don't count with a single city willing to get <unk>
But the amazing thing about cities is that they're worth much more than their building cost.
So we could easily get rid of the world -- maybe hundreds of new cities.
Well, this may sound absurd if you never thought about new cities.
But they simply replaced by buildings.
So imagine that half of those who wanted to live in apartment in apartments and the other half still <unk> to do that.
You could try to increase the ability to do <unk> in all the existing buildings.
But you know that the problem that <unk> is that those buildings and the areas that surround them have rules to avoid <unk> and the <unk>
So it would be very difficult to do all those <unk>
But you could go to a totally new place, to build a new apartment building totally new, and when the rules of that place would be able to build it rather than to put <unk>
So I suggested that governments -- new reform zones to contain cities and I gave them a name, cities.
I later found out that more or less at the same time, <unk> and <unk> were thinking about the challenge of writing Honduras.
They knew that every year about 75,000 <unk> they would come from their country to go to the United States, and they wanted to ask, what could they do to make sure that those people could stay and do those same things in Honduras.
In the summer of 2009 <unk> happened by a constitutional crisis.
In the next regular elections, which is called <unk> <unk> with a platform in which posed reforms and the same time, reconciliation.
He asked <unk> who was his head of <unk>
Meanwhile, I was preparing to give a talk for TEDGlobal.
Through a process of <unk> trial and error and a huge amount of evidence with users, I tried to reduce this complicated concept of cities under <unk> to their most essential.
The first point was the importance of the norms, like those rules that tell you that you can't go and bothered by all the <unk>
We have a lot of attention to new technologies, but you need so much of technologies like rules for <unk> and usually they are the rules that keep us forward.
In the fall of 2010, a friend of Guatemala sent a link to the <unk>
He showed it to <unk>
They called me.
They said to me, <unk> this to the leaders of our <unk>
So in December we met in Miami, in a conference room in a hotel.
I tried to explain to you this point about how valuable cities, much more valuable than the cost of <unk>
And I used this picture that shows the value of land in a place like New York <unk> where, in some cases, are worth a thousand dollars per square meter.
But it was a pretty abstract discussion and at some point, when there was a pause, he said, <unk> maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
And the talk described in very simple terms that a city under <unk> is a place where you start with <unk> <unk> a <unk> which is going to make the rules that are going there and an option for people to choose if they want to go or not live under those norms.
So the president of the <unk> called me and told me that we had to do this project, this is important, this could be the way that our country is going forward.
He asked me to be <unk> and I would talk about the four and five of January.
So I presented another talk full of data, which included a picture like this, which was about explaining that to make a lot of value to a city, this has to be very big.
This is a picture of <unk> and the white line is the new airport that was built in <unk>
Just this airport covers over 100 square miles.
So I was trying to convince the <unk> that to build a new city, you have to start with a site that <unk> at least 1,000 square miles.
That's over 100,000 acres.
The whole world is <unk>
The public faces were very serious and <unk>
The Congress came to the platform, and he said, "Professor <unk> thank you for your talk, but maybe we could see the video of the <unk> talk.
I have here in my <unk>
So I sat down and presented the <unk>
And this explained <unk> that a new city can provide new choices for people.
There would be a choice of a city that could go to that could be in <unk> instead of hundreds of miles away to the North.
And also new choices for leaders.
Because the leaders of the government would need to be able to benefit from the countries that could benefit from the countries of the countries that could help us establish and make the rules of <unk> so that everyone could trust the <unk> so that the <unk> actually <unk>
We went and we saw a site.
This picture is there.
It could be easily <unk> a thousand square miles.
And shortly after, the 19 of January, voted in Congress to <unk> their Constitution and add a constitutional arrangement that allow these special regions of development.
In a country that had just gone through this gravitational crisis, the voting in Congress for this constitutional constitutional was <unk> to one.
All the <unk> all the <unk> in society, <unk>
For <unk> in the <unk> it has to spend twice in Congress.
On February 17, he passed over again in another voting and <unk>
And they immediately after the voting of 21 to the 21 of the 14th of 24, a <unk> <unk> was the two places in the world that are most interested in engaging in cities.
One of them is South Korea.
This is a photo of a new city center which is building in Korea <unk> is bigger than the heart of Boston.
Everything you see there was built in four years, after four years of getting the <unk>
The other country in building cities is Singapore.
In fact, they've built two cities in China and are preparing for a third.
And if you think about this way: this is the point where we are.
They have a place, and they're thinking about a site for the second city.
They are preparing a legal system that would allow the <unk> and the <unk> to operate under a external legal system.
A country has already committed to allow his Supreme Court to be the court of the last instance for this new justice system.
There is <unk> and builders of cities that are very interested in the project.
You can even get some funding.
But the only thing we know that you have already solved is that they have a good number of inhabitants.
There are a lot of companies that wanted to be installed in <unk> especially in a place with an area of free trade, and there are a lot of people who would like to live there.
In the world there are 700 million people who say they would like to change the other place.
There's a million a year that comes out of Latin America to go to the United States.
Many of them are parents who have to leave back to their family to go to get a job, sometimes they're mothers, who have to earn the money for just to eat or buy clothes.
Unfortunately, sometimes there are kids who are trying to meet with their parents who haven't seen it, in some cases, in a decade.
So what does it think about building a new city in <unk>
Or build a dozen of these, or a hundred of these around the world?
What does it look like to think about insist on the various cities that are competing to attract new <unk>
This is an idea worth spreading.
And my friends <unk> I was asked to say, "Thank you TED.
I'm a <unk> and this is my <unk>
But before I show you what there is inside, I'm going to make a public confession -- and it's that I live obsessed with the <unk>
I love to find, and more recently, photographing and post in my blog and colorful and different <unk> for every occasion.
But I don't buy anything new.
My whole clothes is a second hand of <unk> markets and <unk>
Ah, thank you.
The second hand stores allow me to reduce the impact of my <unk> in the environment, and in my <unk>
I go to know people who are <unk> usually my money is going to be a good <unk> My way is <unk> and buying it into my personal search for <unk>
I mean, what am I going to find today?
It will be my size?
I would like color <unk>
It costs less than 20 dollars?
If all the answers are positive, then I feel I've won.
Going back to the theme of my <unk> I want to tell you what we would <unk> for this exciting week at TED.
I mean, what brings all that <unk>
So I'm going to show you exactly what I suit.
I've brought seven pairs of clothes, and nothing else.
We live inside for exactly a week that's all I've put in my <unk>
I thought it would be able to find everything else I would like to use the Palm <unk>
And because I don't know as the woman who walks for TED in inner underwear,  that means I found some things.
And I'd like to show you now the <unk> for this week.
It doesn't sound interesting?
As I do, I'm also going to tell you some of the lessons of life that, or not, I've learned in this adventure to use new clothing.
Let's start with Sunday.
I call this a brilliant tiger <unk>
You don't have to spend a lot of money to look good.
You can almost see you quite a phenomenal time for less than 50 dollars.
All of the together, including <unk> it took me <unk> and it's the most expensive thing I've ever used in the week.
<unk> color is energy.
It's almost <unk> impossible to be <unk> when you're wearing a bright red <unk>
If you're happy, you're going to attract other people happy.
<unk> <unk> is <unk>
I've spent a lot of time in life trying to be myself and at the same time <unk>
Just yourself.
If you get rid of the right people -- not just <unk> you get <unk>
<unk> <unk> of the child that get in.
Sometimes people tell me that it seems to play the <unk> or I remember their little <unk>
I like to <unk> and say, <unk>
<unk> <unk> is the key.
If you think you do well with something, it's almost sure you are.
And if you think you don't get good with something, it's probably also true.
My mother taught me this day after day.
But it wasn't until the 30 years I really understood its meaning.
And I'm going to explain it in a few seconds.
If you think you're a beautiful person in your inside and outside, you don't have to look <unk>
So there's no excuse for one of this audience.
We must be able to achieve everything we want to do.
Thank you.
<unk> A universal truth to you: <unk> <unk> go with everything.
And finally, <unk> <unk> a personal and unique style is a great way to tell the world something about you without having to say a word.
I've tried it over and over again when people approached me this week just by what I was using, and we had fantastic conversations.
Obviously this is not going to go into my little <unk>
So before I went home to Brooklyn, to Brooklyn, I'm going to give it all the time.
Because the lesson I'm trying to learn about this week is that we have to leave the back of certain things.
I don't need to get emotionally emotionally to these things, because at the end of the corner, there will always be another crazy suit, <unk> and brilliant <unk> if there's a little bit of love in my heart and I'm after.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
This is a representation of your brain that we can split up in two parts.
The left side, which is the logic and the right side, which is the intuitive.
So if you take a scale to measure the <unk> of every <unk> we could design a blueprint of our brain.
For example, this would be someone who is completely logical.
This would be someone who's totally intuitive.
So where do you get your brain at this scale?
Some of them <unk> for one of these ends, but I think for most of the members of this audience, his brain is something like this -- with a great <unk> in both <unk> at the same time.
It's not that they're mutually <unk>
You can be logical and intuitive.
I consider to me one of those people, which as most of the other quantum physical physicists -- we need very logical logic to make these complicated ideas.
But at the same time, we need very intuition to make the experiments really work.
How do we develop this <unk> Well, we like to play with things.
We put to play with them and then we see how they react. And then we developed our intuition on that point.
And actually, you do the same thing.
You know, I have to have developed with the step of the years is the one that says one thing can be only in one place at once.
I mean, it may sound weird to think that one thing is in two different places at the same time, but you weren't born with this <unk> the <unk>
I remember watching a kid playing in a parking bar.
It was a little boy, and I didn't do it very well, always <unk>
But I bet the playing with that bar in parking lot -- he taught him a valuable lesson -- and that is that the great things don't allow them to be <unk> and stay in a place.
This is a huge conceptual model that you can have in the world, except you're a particle physicist.
It would be a terrible model for a particle physicist, because they don't play with the parking lot, they play with these strange particles.
And when they play with their particles, they discover that they do all kinds of really strange things -- like they can go through walls, or they can be in two different places at the same time.
And then they wrote all these observations, and they called it theory of quantum mechanics.
At that point, it was the physics of a few years, you need about quantum mechanics to describe those tiny particles.
But you didn't need to describe the great objects around us every day.
That's not very good at my intuition, and maybe it's because I don't play very often with particles.
Well, sometimes I play with them, but not too much.
And I've never seen them.
I mean, nobody saw a <unk>
But neither would be done well at my logical side.
Because if it's all made of little particles and all the little particles follow the principles of quantum mechanics, so I should not go to the principles of quantum mechanics.
I don't find the reason why I don't should.
And so I would feel much better if I could prove that a common object also follows the principles of quantum mechanics.
That's why a few years ago, I proposed to do exactly that.
And I did.
This is the first object you can see that has been in an overlap of quantum mechanics.
What we see here is a little computer chip.
And you can try to see the green dot right in the middle.
That's the little piece of metal I'm going to talk about in a minute.
This is a picture of the object.
And here I'm going to make it a little bit. It's just at the center.
And then we make a quick approach, the little <unk> of metal.
What we see is a little bit of metal, very much of a springboard and it can be engaged in a platform.
And so I did this almost in the same way that you would do a computer chip.
I went to a clean room with a chip of silicon again, and I put all the big machines for about 100 hours.
For the last material, I had to build my own machine -- to make this hole in a form of swimming <unk> which is under the device.
This device has the ability to be in a quantum overlap -- but it needs a little bit of help.
Let me make an analogy.
You know how awkward it is to be in an elevator full of people.
I mean, when I am in an elevator alone, I do all kinds of rare things, but then when other people will go up to do that stuff, because I don't want them to <unk> or, actually, you know.
Quantum mechanics says that inanimate objects behave in the same way.
The <unk> of the inanimate objects are not only people -- it's the light that <unk> it and the wind that goes on its side and the heat of the room.
So we knew that if we wanted this little bit of metal to behave in the quantum mechanics, we would have to drag all the other passengers.
And that's what we did.
<unk> the lights, then we introduced a <unk> and pulled it down to a temperature of less than a degree of less than a degree above absolute zero.
Now, when you're just in the <unk> the little piece of metal is free to act like that.
So we measure their movements.
We found that it moved in very strange ways.
Instead of staying perfectly still, he was <unk> and the way he was going to be like, was like a breathing of this way -- like a <unk> that expands and <unk>
And by giving it a soft environment, we were able to make it happen, and you don't know at the same time -- something that only happens with quantum mechanics.
So what I'm telling you is something really fantastic.
What does it mean that a <unk> thing is going to do it at the same time?
Let's think about atoms.
In one case, all the trillion atoms that make that piece of metal are still and at the same time that same atoms are moving up for the top and down.
It's just in certain <unk> when those are <unk>
At the rest of the time they're <unk>
It means that every atom is in two different places at the same time, which means that all the metal piece is in two different places.
I think this is great.
Really.
<unk> <unk> in a clean room to do this for all those years, because, watch this, the scale between a single atom -- and that piece of metal is more or less the same as the difference between that little metal and you.
So if one just atom can be in two different places at the same time, and that piece of metal can be in two different places, why don't you too?
I mean, it's my logic that you talk about.
So imagine if they were in many places at the same time, how would that be?
How do you act your consciousness if your body was <unk> in space?
There's another part of the story.
And it's when we turned it up, and we turned the lights and we looked into the box, we saw that metal was still there in one piece.
And I could get to this new intuition, apparently all the objects on the elevator actually are only quantum objects that are just <unk> in a small space.
You hear a lot about a lot about that quantum mechanics claims that everything is interconnected.
Well, that's not so <unk>
It's more profound than that.
It's that those connections, your connections to all the things that surround you, literally define who you are, and that's the deep queerness of quantum mechanics.
Thank you.
My name is <unk>
And 18 months ago, I was doing another job at Google, until I launched the idea of doing something related to museums and art to my head that's here and that allowed me to do it.
It took me 18 months.
We have a lot of negotiations and stories, and it was done with 17 museums very interesting in nine countries.
But I'm going to focus on <unk>
There's a lot of stories about why we did.
I think my own story is just explaining simply in this slide and this is access.
I grew up in India.
<unk> from a great education -- not <unk> but I didn't have access to many of these museums and works of art.
So when I started traveling and go to museums, I started learning a lot.
And working on Google, I try to really make the desire to make it more accessible by technology.
So we formed a team, a great team of people, and we started to do it.
Better that shows the demo of then to tell you a couple of interesting things that we've done from their launch.
So, <unk> we're going to <unk>
Look around all the museums there.
There's the gallery at MoMA, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I'm actually going to go into one of my favorites, the <unk> art museum in New York City.
There are two ways to do it -- very simple.
We click on the museum.
It doesn't matter where they are, <unk> or <unk> that really doesn't matter.
You move around and get <unk>
Would you want to navigate the <unk>
We open the above, and, with one click, we jump inside.
You're inside the hall,
How do you keep going. What are they <unk>
<unk>
Thank you, but I haven't come to the best.
Now I'm in front of one of my favorite paintings, "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> in <unk>
I see the <unk> sign.
If the museum shows us the image, we click there.
See, this is one of the images.
Here's all the data from <unk>
For those of you who are really interested in art, you can click there, but I'm going to click here right now.
And this is one of the images we've captured on what we call the <unk> technology.
So this image, for example, <unk> I think, about 10,000 billion <unk>
And there are many people who ask me, "And what do you get with 10,000 million <unk>
So I'm going to show you what you really do with 10,000 million <unk>
It can zoom in in a very simple way.
You see fun things that are happening.
I love this guy, his expression has no price.
But if you really want to do that.
So I started to play, and I found something that was going on there.
And I said, "A moment, this looks like <unk>
And I found that kids were actually playing something.
I talked to a little bit, I talked to some people from the <unk> and I actually found that this is a game called <unk> which is called a <unk> with a stick on a Tuesday Tuesday <unk>
And apparently it was very popular.
I don't know why they did, but I've learned something about it.
And now we're going to get even further into depth and you'll see that you can actually get into the cracks.
Now just to give you a little bit of perspective, I'm going to pull the image, and you really see what it is.
Here is where we were, and this is the painting.
The best thing is coming, a second.
So now we're going to quickly jump to <unk> in New York City.
Here's another one of my favorites, "The <unk>
The example I showed was to find details.
But what if you want to see the <unk>
And if you want to see how van Gogh actually created this <unk>
It goes up and really <unk>
I'm going to one of my favorite parts on this picture, and I'm really going to get to the cracks.
This is <unk> <unk> I think I'd never seen it as well before.
I'm going to show you another one of my favorite functions.
There are lots of things over here, but I don't have time to <unk>
This is the really cool part, it's called <unk>
All of you, absolutely everyone, no matter whether it's rich or poor, or if you have a <unk> that gives you the same way.
You can online to create your own museum, to create its own collection from all these images.
It's very simple -- I've created this function that I call <unk> <unk> -- we just made a zooming around it.
This is <unk> at the National Gallery in London.
You can write things, send it to your friends and keep a conversation about what you feel about looking at these <unk>
So in conclusion, I think for me, the main thing is that all the amazing things really don't come from Google.
No, in my opinion, even none of the museums.
Maybe I should not say this.
Actually, they come from those artists.
And that's been my experience experience with this.
I mean, I hope that in this digital means doing justice to its work of art and that is represented properly online.
And the great question I do today is you did this to repeat the experience of going to a <unk>
And the answer is no.
It's to supplement the experience.
And that's it. Thank you.
Thank you.
Good evening everybody.
I have something to show you.
Think of it is a <unk> a <unk>
In our lab, we call it cultural design.
I'm going to tell you a little bit about this.
If you look at this picture -- all the kids in Italy in Italy grow with this photo on the wall of his bedroom. But the reason I show you this is that it has occurred something very interesting about <unk> careers in the last two decades.
Now sometime ago, if you wanted to win a career from Formula 1, take a budget and put it into a good pilot and a good car.
And if the car and the pilot was good enough, you invented the race.
This is what in engineering, in engineering.
It's essentially a system that has two <unk> a sensor and a <unk>
What's interesting today is that the control systems in real time are starting to enter our lives.
Our cities, in the last few years, have been covered with networks and electronics.
They're getting computers in the open.
And as <unk> are starting to respond differently and can be <unk> and <unk>
<unk> cities is big.
As a note -- I wanted to mention that cities are only two percent of the crust of the planet, but they represent 50 percent of the <unk> population.
75 percent of the <unk> consumption -- to 80 percent of the CO2 emissions.
If we could do something with the cities, it would be a big thing.
Beyond cities, all these <unk> and <unk> are entering our everyday objects.
This is from a <unk> exhibition for late year at MoMA, during the summer.
It's called <unk>
Well, our objects, the environment, they start <unk>
It's kind of like almost all the atoms in the existing atoms they were <unk> and <unk>
And that's completely changing the interaction that as humans have with the outside environment.
It's almost like the old dream of Miguel <unk>
You know, when Michelangelo <unk> the <unk> is said that at the end took the hammer and threw it up to the Moses -- you can actually see a little <unk> <unk> and he said he said, <unk> non <unk> <unk> what didn't <unk>
Well, today, for the first time, our environment starts to <unk>
And I'm going to show you just a few <unk> <unk> <unk> in the idea of capturing the environment and push it out.
Let's start with the detection.
The first project I wanted to share with you is really one of the first projects in our lab.
This was four years ago in Italy.
It was a summer in 2006.
It was the year when Italy won the World Cup <unk>
Maybe some of you remember it, played and France, and at the end <unk> gave the <unk>
And anyway, at the end I won Italy.
Now let's see what happened that day by watching <unk> activity in the network.
Here we see the city.
You see the <unk> in the middle and the <unk> River.
It's the morning before play.
The time line is at the top.
At the afternoon, there are people here and there are <unk>
It starts the <unk> silence.
<unk> from France.
People are going to make the people a call and go to the bathroom.
Second time. End of time.
First time <unk> second.
<unk> and at a moment, the <unk>
Italy, <unk> Italy, <unk>
That night they all went to <unk> the center.
You see the big summit.
The next day they went to the center of the team and the prime minister then.
And then the whole world is <unk>
You see the picture of the place called <unk> <unk> where, since the time <unk> people are going to be a great party, you can see the peak at the end of the day.
This is just an example of how today we can measure the pulse of the city in a way that we couldn't do just a few years ago.
Another quick example of <unk> is not about people, but things we use and consume it.
Today, we know all about the root of our objects.
This is a map that shows all the chips that make a <unk> how do you <unk>
But we know very little about where things are.
So in this project, we developed some small tags to track the trash in their shift in the system.
We started with a few volunteers who helped us in Seattle a little more than a year ago, to tag what they were <unk> different kinds of things, as you can see, things that in all kinds of <unk>
Then we put a little chip, a tag on the garbage and then we started <unk>
These are the <unk> results.
From <unk>
After a week.
With this information, we realized that there are lots of <unk> in the system.
We can do the same thing with a lot less energy.
These are data that didn't exist before.
You're going on very complicated things, and there's a lot of <unk>
But the other thing that we believe is that if you look at every day that the cup that we <unk> is still somewhere on the planet.
If the plastic bottle that we dropped on a day still follow there.
If we show that to people, then we'll be able to promote some change of <unk>
That was the reason for the project.
My colleague at MIT, <unk> <unk> could tell us much more about detecting and a lot of other great things that we can do with that, but I wanted to go to the second part that we talked about at the beginning, which is the environment.
And the first project is something we did a couple of years ago.
It all started with a question of the mayor of the city, who came up and told us that Spain and South Europe have a beautiful tradition of water use in public space in architecture.
And the question was, how can technology technology, new technology, attached to that?
And one of the ideas that we developed at MIT, in a workshop, was to imagine that they have a <unk> and <unk> valves <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
It creates like a water curtain, with pixels of water.
If you drop the pixels on them, I'll show you patterns, images, texts.
And when we zoom in, the curtain will open for us to happen, like you see in the image.
We introduced this to the mayor of <unk>
He liked a lot of it.
And they took a commission to design the building to the entrance to the entrance to <unk>
We call it <unk> <unk>
The whole building is made of water.
There is no windows and no windows, but when you get to open up for you to make it happen.
The ceiling is also covered in water.
And if there's a little bit of wind, if you want to minimize the <unk> you lower your roof.
Or you can close the building and all the architecture is going to, like in this case.
Those days there will always be someone, in the winter, when the roof, you get the roof, somebody who was there and said <unk>
No, it's not that you've got it, but when it comes down almost all the architecture away.
Here's how it works.
You see the people who are on the inside.
And here I am just trying to do not <unk> when the sensors open the water.
I think I should tell you what happened one night when all the sensors stopped working.
That night was actually even more fun.
All the kids in <unk> came to the building, because the way to interact had changed a little bit.
It wasn't a building that was going to open to leave you -- but a building that was following <unk> and holes in water, and you had to jump to not get wet.
<unk> <unk> And for us that was very interesting because as architects, engineers, designers, always we think about how people will give our designs.
But then the reality is always unpredictable.
And that's the beauty of doing things to interact that people use.
This is a picture of the building with the physical pixels and the pixels of water, and of projections about them.
And this is what led us to think about the next project I'm going to show you.
Imagine that those pixels could start to fly.
Imagine that they could have little helicopters in the air, and each one had a small pixel that changes color as if it was a cloud that moves in space.
This is the video.
Imagine a helicopter, as the one we saw before, which is moving with others in sync.
Could we form this cloud,
It's kind of a flexible screen like this with a normal <unk>
Or it's normal -- but in three dimensions, where what it changes is the light, not the position of the <unk>
You can play it with a different guy.
So imagine the screen appear on different scales and sizes, in different kinds of resolution.
And then all of that could be a cloud of pixels in 3D that you can reach, and see from very different <unk>
This is the real <unk> <unk> going down to form a <unk> like before.
When the light lights up, it looks like this. The same thing we saw before.
Imagine every one of them controlled by a person.
We can have every pixel with a input that comes from people, the movement of people, etc., etc.
I want to show you something for the first time.
We've been working with <unk> <unk> <unk> of the best <unk> dancers of today, the star of the New York City and <unk> <unk> to capture their movement in 3D and use them as input for <unk>
Here we can see <unk> dancing.
On the left you see the <unk> in different <unk>
It's so <unk> 3D <unk> in real time as a movement capture.
It can make it all the movement.
You can go all the way.
And once we have the pixels we can play with them, with color and movement, with gravity and <unk>
We want to use this as a input for the <unk>
I wanted to show you the last project that we're working on.
It's something for the London Olympics.
It's called the <unk>
And the idea is, to imagine again, that we could engage people to do something and change our reproductive environment, like a <unk> farm like <unk> but with a cloud.
So imagine that we could make it all a little bit for a <unk>
And I think the remarkable thing about the last few years is that, in the last two decades, we spent the physical world to the digital world.
We have <unk> everything, like knowledge, and it's accessible to the Internet.
So today, for the first time -- and the Obama campaign -- we can go from the digital world, of the digital power of networks, to the physical world.
In our case, this may we use it to design and make a <unk>
That would mean something built in a city.
But tomorrow can be to address the challenges of today: think about climate change or CO2 emissions, how will happen from the digital world to the physical world.
The idea is that we can make people involved in doing this together, in a collective way.
The cloud is a cloud, again, made of pixels in the same way that the real cloud is a cloud of particles.
And those particles are water, whereas in our cloud are <unk>
It's a physical structure in London, but covered with <unk>
You can move it around having different experiences.
You can see from the bottom, to be able to share the main moments of the 2012 Olympics, and even more, and it can be used as a form of connection to the community.
So, it's a physical cloud of the sky as something you can go up, like a new <unk> of London.
You can go in there.
As if it was a new digital <unk> at night, but the most important thing is to be a new experience for anyone who goes to the top.
Thank you.
Would you like to be better than they are.
Suppose I told you that, with only a few changes in your genes, you could improve the <unk> for a more accurate, more accurate and faster.
Or maybe you would like to be in a better way, to be stronger to have more resistance.
Would you like to be more attractive and sure about ourselves?
What about to live with good health?
Or maybe these people who always wanted to be more creative.
What is the most <unk>
What do you want, if you could choose something?
<unk> <unk> <unk>
How much people do you think of creativity?
Raise your hand. Let me see.
<unk> probably had the number of creative creative people.
That's very good.
How many of the <unk>
A few more.
And the physical state.
<unk>
What about <unk>
Oh, most of them makes me feel very well as a doctor.
If you could have some of the world that would be very different.
It's just <unk>
Or maybe it's possible?
Evolution has been a <unk> issue here at the TED Conference but I want to give you the eyes of a doctor on the subject.
The great <unk> of the 20th century, <unk> <unk> that also <unk> in the Church of <unk> <unk> wrote an essay called "No biology makes sense except for the light of <unk>
But if they actually accept the biological evolution consider this is just the past, or the future?
It's about the other or us?
This is another look at the tree of life.
The human part of this branch, well on one end, it is, of course, the most interesting thing.
<unk> of a common ancestor with modern chimpanzees about six or eight million years ago.
There has been maybe 20 or 25 different species of <unk>
Some of you have gone and <unk>
We have been here about <unk> years.
It might seem like we're very far from other parts of this tree of life, but actually, in most of the basic machinery of our cells is more or less the same.
You realize that we can harness and control the machinery of a common bacterium to produce the protein of human insulin that is used to treat the <unk>
This is not like human insulin but it's the same protein, chemically <unk> from the <unk>
And talking about bacteria -- you realize that we all carry on the whole intestine that the cells that we have in the rest of the body?
Maybe 10 times more.
I mean, think about -- when Antonio <unk> does the <unk> think about <unk>
The gut is a wonderfully humanizing environment for those bacteria.
It's warm dark <unk> it's very <unk>
And we're going to provide all the nutrients that you can want to want without effort of it.
It's really like a quick pathway for bacteria with the occasional disruption of some rush that we rush to <unk>
But on the other way, we're a wonderful environment for those bacteria in the same way that they are essential to our life.
They help digest nutrients and protect us from certain diseases.
But what does the future?
We're in a kind of evolutionary balance like a species?
Or meant to become something different, something maybe better adapted to the <unk>
In this vast symphony of the world, the living symphony of the universe, life on Earth is like a brief <unk> the animal kingdom, as one and only human life, a small note of grace.
That was us.
And it was also the <unk> of this talk, so I hope you have <unk>
When I first went to college, I had my first class of biology.
I was fascinated by the elegance and beauty of biology.
I fell in love with the power of evolution, and I was aware of a fundamental thing about the most existence of life, in the <unk> organisms -- every cell simply divided and all the genetic energy of that cell is transmitted to two immune cells.
But when the organisms come from, things start to change.
It goes into the sexual reproduction.
And something very important, with the emergence of sexual reproduction that passes the genome, the rest of the body becomes <unk>
In fact, you might say that the <unk> of the body comes into evolution in the same moment of sexual reproduction.
I have to confess that when I was a college student, I was thinking, "Well, <unk> death -- it seemed pretty reasonable at that time, but with every year that was going on, every year I had more <unk>
I came to understand the feelings of George <unk> who still <unk> in Las Vegas in their late 90 years.
And one night someone hits his hotel door to the hotel.
He opens the door.
In front of him is a gorgeous <unk>
He looks at it, and he says, <unk> for a <unk> <unk>
He said, George, he says <unk>
I realized, as a doctor, who was working for a different goal to the goal of <unk> not necessarily entirely different.
I was trying to preserve the body.
I wanted you to get healthy.
I wanted to regain the disease in disease.
I wanted us to live more and more healthy.
Evolution is going to move the genome to the next <unk> adapting and <unk> generation after generation.
From an evolutionary point of view, you and I are like <unk> really designed to send the genetic charge to the next level, and then we will let us fall into the sea.
I think we all have the feeling that <unk> Woody Allen when he said, "I don't want to achieve immortality through my work.
I want to <unk> it <unk>
Evolution doesn't necessarily promote longevity.
It doesn't necessarily happen to the bigger or the stronger or the faster and even the smartest one.
Evolution favors the best adapted to their environment.
That's the only survival and success.
In the bottom of the ocean the <unk> bacteria that can survive the heat of the <unk> that <unk> if there were fish there, fish dry things, and yet they've managed to make that an environment <unk>
So what does this, when we look at what's happening in evolution, and if we come back to think about the place of humans in evolution, and in particular, if we look ahead at the stage, I would argue that there are lots of possibilities.
The first one is that I didn't know.
We've reached a kind of balance.
And the underlying reasoning is that through medicine, first of all, we have known to preserve a lot of genes that otherwise would have been <unk> and separated from the population.
And secondly, as a species, we have <unk> our environment so that they fit to us as well as we adapt to it.
And by the way, <unk> <unk> and <unk> so much that it is no longer possible to have the isolation of that evolution.
A second possibility is that it is produces an evolution of the natural species, dictated by the forces of nature.
And the argument here is that the gears of evolution roll slowly, but they're <unk>
And in terms of <unk> when you like <unk> planets are going to exist and environmental changes that can produce evolution in a natural way.
But there's a third possibility, which is <unk> intriguing and terrifying one.
I call it <unk> the new evolution, which is not simply <unk> but <unk> and selected for us as individuals in the choices that we <unk>
Now, how could this happen?
How could we get to do this?
So first consider the reality that many people today, in some cultures, are making decisions about their offspring.
In some cultures, they're choosing to have more males than women.
It's not necessarily good for society, but it's what you choose to be the individual and familiar.
Think also that if you could be able to be able to be able to be able to choose not only the sex of their <unk> but in their own body to make the genetic <unk> to cure or prevent disease.
And if we could make genetic changes to eliminate diabetes or Alzheimer's disease or reduce the risk of cancer or eliminating <unk>
You don't want to make those changes in your <unk>
If we look at the future, that kind of changes is going to be more and more possible.
The Human Genome Project started in 1990, and he sued 13 years.
<unk> <unk> million dollars.
When I was finished, in 2004, he could do the same work for 20 million dollars in three or four months.
You can actually get a full sequence of three billion base base base bases at a cost of about 20,000 and a week.
Not too much to be able to make the human genome for <unk> and being more and more at the grasp of all.
They're coming into those changes.
The same technology that has produced the human insulin in bacteria can make viruses that are not only going to protect us but they are going to be immunity against other viruses.
You know, or there's no experimental trial in course with the vaccine against the HIV vaccine, in a plant plant.
You can imagine something nice about the <unk>
That's actually today and the future is going to be more and more possible.
Imagine then only two little <unk>
They can change the cells of their bodies but if they could change the cells of their <unk>
And if they could change the sperm and the <unk> or change the <unk> egg -- and give their children a better chance of a more healthy life, eliminate the <unk> reduce the risk of cancer?
Who doesn't want children more <unk>
And then, that same <unk> technology, that same engine of science that can produce the changes to prevent diseases is going to be able to also adopt <unk> <unk> a better memory.
Why don't we have the ingenuity of a Ken <unk> especially if you could get it to the next generation of the machine <unk>
Why not have a <unk> muscle that allowed us to run faster and more <unk>
Why don't we live longer?
This is going to be <unk>
And when we are in conditions to pass this to the next generation and we can adopt the attributes that we wanted to have become the evolution of before the <unk>
We're going to take a process that would usually take a hundred thousand years and we can get it to 1,000 years and maybe happen within the next 100 years.
These are elections that their grandchildren, or grandchildren of their grandchildren, are going to have them.
We're going to use these choices in a better society, more successful, more successful.
Or, let's choose selectively selectively attributes that we want for some of us, but not for others?
Let's build a society that is more boring and more robust and more robust and more <unk>
This is the kind of question we're going to have to face.
And most profound of all, we're going to be able to develop wisdom and inherit the wisdom we need to make these <unk> decisions.
For good or worse, and before what I could do -- these choices are going to depend on us.
Thank you.
Imagine a great explosion when you're at 900 feet high.
Imagine an airplane full of smoke.
Imagine a engine by doing <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> It sounds terrifying.
Well, I had a single seat that day. He was sitting in the <unk>
It was the only one I could talk to the flight assistants here.
And so he immediately looked at it, and they said, "No problem. You probably slam <unk>
The pilot had gone down the plane, and we were not so far.
You could see Manhattan here.
Two minutes later, three things happened at the same time.
The pilot <unk> the airplane with the Hudson River.
Mostly, that's not <unk>
The engines.
Imagine being in an airplane and not noise.
And then he said three words.
The three words three words ever heard.
He said, <unk> for the <unk>
I didn't have to talk more with the flight <unk>
I was able to see it in his eyes.
It was terror. Life <unk>
I want to share with you three things I learned about myself.
I learned that everything changes in a second.
We have this list of things to do before they die, these things that we want to do in life, and I thought about all the people I wanted to get in and I didn't did, all the fences that I wanted to repair all the experiences that I wanted to have and never <unk>
As I thought about that later on, I came up with a phrase, which is <unk> wine <unk>
Because if the wine is ready and the person is there, I'm going to make it open.
I don't want to <unk> nothing in life.
And that urgency, that way, has really changed my life.
The second thing I learned that day -- and this is as <unk> the bridge George Washington -- which was not a lot of -- I thought about, <unk> I really feel a great <unk>
I've lived a good life.
In my humanity, and my mistakes have tried to improve everything I did.
But in my humanity also gives place to my ego.
And I'm sorry for the time that I was going to do with things that don't care with people who do matter.
And I thought about my relationship with my wife, with my friends, with people.
And then, as a <unk> at that, I decided to eliminate negative energy from my life.
It's not perfect, but it's much better.
I haven't had a fight with my wife.
It feels like <unk>
I am no longer trying to have <unk> <unk>
The third thing I learned -- and this is like your mental clock, and this is like your mental clock, right?
You see the water <unk>
I'm saying, "Please come from?
I don't want this to be <unk> in 20 pieces like you see in those <unk>
And as I was <unk> I had the feeling of, <unk> die isn't fear.
It's almost like we've been <unk> for this whole life.
But it was very sad.
I didn't want to tell me, I love my life.
And that sadness is <unk> in a single thought, which is, just desire one thing.
I wish I could see my children growing up.
One month later, I was in a performance of my daughter -- first grade, not much artistic talent -- <unk>  And I scream, <unk> like a little bit.
And to me, that was the whole reason to be the world.
At that point, I understand that to connect those two points, which the only thing that matters in my life is being a great parent.
For all, the only goal that I have in life is being a good parent.
He gave me a miracle, of not dying that day.
And it was given to me another gift, which was the possibility of looking at the future and back and live in another way.
You guys are flying today, the challenge to imagine that the same thing happens on your airplane -- and for why it's not that -- but imagine, and how do you <unk>
What is it that <unk> who are still expecting to do because they think they're going to live careful.
How does their relationships change and negative energy in them?
And most importantly, they are the best parents to <unk>
Thank you.
I've clearly been blessed in the life with a lot of projects.
But the most cool thing that I worked was for this guy.
The guy is called <unk>
<unk> was one of the most important <unk> in the 1980s.
One day came to his house after running and said, "Dad, I feel like a <unk> in the <unk>
And that was the beginning of ALS.
Today, it has total paralysis.
You can only use your eyes.
Their work influenced me.
I have a design company and animation, so obviously, graffiti is something <unk> that we admire and <unk> in the world of art.
So we decided we were going to go to <unk> <unk> and their cause.
So I went and met his brother and her father and I said, "We're going to give you this money.
What are they going to do with <unk>
And his brother said, "I just want to talk about Tony again.
I just want you to communicate with him and he's able to communicate with me."
And I said, "A second -- it's not that <unk> seen Stephen <unk> is not that all people with paralysis, can communicate through those <unk>
And he said, "No, unless you are important and you have a very good sure you can't actually do it.
These devices are not affordable for people."
And I said, "Well, how do they communicate then?"
Did anybody see the movie <unk> <unk> and <unk>
They communicate that way, and they're doing with the finger.
I said, "That's <unk> How could it be?"
So I came up with the only desire to deliver a check and instead of that signed a check that didn't have the least idea of how I was going to <unk>
I met her with his brother and his father in that very precise time, "All right, well, this is the <unk> Tony is going to build a machine, and we're going to find a way to make her art again.
Because it's ridiculous that somebody who has so much on your inner can't do it.
So I spoke at a conference a couple months later.
I met these guys called <unk> <unk> Research <unk> who have a technology that allows them to project a light on any surface and then with a laser pointer -- you draw on that and a laser pointer of that negative space.
So they go around making art facilities like this.
All the things that they <unk> they are part of a cycle of life.
They first start with sex organs then with the bad words, then with the heart attacks, and then people start doing art.
But there was always a life cycle in his <unk>
And so it started the journey.
And about two years later, about a year later, after a lot of organization and a lot of a way to move things on one side we had achieved a couple of things.
One, you touch the gates of the insurance companies and we got a machine so that you could make it a machine -- like Stephen <unk>
Which was great.
And seriously, it's the most <unk> I call it <unk> because when you talk to the guy -- you get an email from him, and you say, "Not <unk> This guy is <unk>
The other thing that we did was bringing seven programmers from all the <unk> world from all the <unk> to our home.
My wife, the children and I, we moved to the garage of the back and these hackers and programmers and <unk> and <unk> took over the house.
A lot of our friends thought that we did something completely stupid and when they were going to have taken away the frames of the walls and their place would have <unk>
But for two weeks, we got to go to the <unk> <unk> my son was part of my dog, and we created this.
It's called <unk> and you can see the <unk>
It's a pair of <unk> <unk> <unk> that we buy in the <unk> <unk> Beach, a little bit of copper wire and <unk> and Radio <unk>
We take a camera <unk> we put it into a LED light, and now there's a device that is free -- and you build one thing, we published the source code, the software goes down in a free way.
And we created a device that has no limitation at all.
There's no insurance company that says, <unk>
There is no hospital that can tell us.
Any person with paralysis, today has access to drawing and communicate with only their eyes.
Thank you.
Thank you very much for you. That was awesome.
So at the end of the two weeks, we went back to the <unk> room.
I love this photo because this is the room of another person and that's his room.
There was all this <unk> and <unk> during the great opening.
And after about a year of planning, two weeks of <unk> of all night, Tony came back to draw for the first time in seven years.
And this is a wonderful picture because this is the support system of his life and it's looking through the support system of your life.
We ran the bed so I could see.
And we put a projector on a brick wall outside the hospital.
And he came back to draw for the first time in his family and friends and you can imagine, what was the feeling in the parking lot.
The funny thing was that we had to take in the parking spaces, so we feel like we were <unk> the graffiti as well.
At the end of this he sent us an email and this was what he said, "This was the first time I drew in seven years.
I felt like I had been under the water and somebody would finally come to <unk> and they would get me out of there so I could <unk>
It's not <unk>
In a way, that's our <unk>
That's what keeps us in motion.
And we have a long way to go through this.
It's a cool device but it's the equivalent of a <unk> <unk>
Somebody with this artistic potential deserves much more.
So we're trying to figure out how to improve it and make it faster and robust.
Since then we've had all kinds of recognition.
We've won a lot of awards.
Remember, it's <unk> none of us are making money with this.
Everything comes out of our own pockets.
The prizes were the <unk> "Oh, this is <unk>
Armstrong <unk> something about us, and then, in December, Time magazine recognized us as one of the best <unk> <unk> and it was really cool.
The best thing about this -- and this is what ends up at April of this year at April of this year at April of Los Angeles at the center of Los Angeles is going to be an exhibition called <unk> in <unk>
And <unk> in the <unk> is going to have the best <unk> of urban art, <unk> <unk> <unk> all of them are going to be there.
<unk> is going to be on the show which is pretty impressive.
So basically this is my idea: if you see something that is not possible, do it happen.
None of what there is in this room was possible -- the computer -- the computer, the microphone, the <unk> nothing was possible.
Do it <unk> anything in this room.
I'm not a programmer, I never did anything with <unk> recognition technology I just recognized something and <unk> with amazing people to make it happen.
And these are the questions that I want everyone to do every day when we find something that we feel like to do. If it's not right now, when? And if I'm not me, who?
Thank you guys.
I've spent the last few years in situations very difficult and at the same time a bit dangerous.
I went to the hard <unk>
I worked in a <unk> mine.
It will be made in areas of <unk> difficult and dangerous.
And I spent 30 days eating this fun at first, something difficult in the middle, very dangerous at the end.
In fact, in a great part of my career I've been <unk> in situations in the only goal to treat. Let's look at social questions in ways that we have to make interesting social questions -- and hopefully analyzing it in a way that you see fun and accessible to the audience.
So when I knew I would come here to do a TEDTalk on the world of brands and <unk> I wanted to do something a little different.
So some of you may have heard of, or not, a couple of weeks ago, I took a chance to <unk>
I sent some text messages on Facebook, some on Twitter, I volunteered for the name of my TEDTalk TEDTalk in 2011.
What had been the following. It was <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my TEDTalk -- that you have no idea what it comes and as the content could look at the face, especially if I put it in ridiculous to you or your company to do it.
But I said this, it's a very good opportunity to be done.
Do you know how many people look at these <unk>
<unk>
It's a headline in progress, by the way.
So even with that <unk> I knew someone was going to buy the rights for name.
If you had asked me a year ago, I didn't have been able to do it for certain.
But in the new film I'm working on, we looked at the <unk> <unk>
And as I said earlier, I've gotten into horrible situations in the last few years, but nothing could be done with me for something so hard or as dangerous as I got into the rooms with these guys.
You see, I had this idea for a movie.
Morgan <unk> I want to make a film that tried to treat products, and the marketing and the <unk> and that the whole film came together with <unk> and marketing and advertising.
The movie is going to call "The largest <unk> <unk>
What happens in "The <unk> <unk> is that all the top at the bottom, at first, has images of brand, all the time; from the <unk> that comes before the title of the title of the title of the title of the day.
Now this brand brand <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
These people were <unk> by the film to <unk> forever.
And so the film is looking at this idea -- <unk> <unk> is <unk> Is it <unk> It's <unk> You know, <unk>
I'm a <unk> <unk> <unk> -- it was more for <unk>
It was <unk> <unk>
But we're not just going to have the sponsor of the brand X in the title -- but we're going to make sure we get rid of all the categories we can in the film.
You might have a shoe and you get the most cool shoe you have <unk>
The most cool car that you've driven in the greatest <unk> the best drink that you have <unk> <unk> of "The greatest <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> The idea is then to show the brands as part of life, to make them <unk> the <unk> <unk> by making the <unk> MS: And we actually show the whole process of how it works.
The goal of the film is transparency.
You're going to see the whole process in this movie.
That's the whole idea -- everything shot it from beginning to end.
And I would love to help me make it happen.
Robert <unk> You know, it's funny because it's the first time I hear that -- it's the most respect for the audience.
<unk> However, I don't know how responsive people are going to be the people at that.
<unk> You have a <unk> I don't know if you <unk> it's very <unk> but you know how it goes to <unk> <unk> I don't know what money you need to do this?
MS: A million and a half million <unk> <unk> John <unk> -- I think it's going to be hard for the meeting with them, but it's certainly going to be worth a couple of big marks,
<unk> Who knows, maybe for the moment that the movie comes out, we look at a lot of <unk> <unk>
MS: What do you think is going to be the answer?
So Stuart <unk> Most of the responses will be <unk>
MS: But it will be hard to <unk> by the film or to be I?
JK: So both things.
MS: ... means you're not very optimistic.
And so I was <unk> I need help.
MK: I can help.
MS: All right. <unk> <unk> Awesome.
MK: We have to think about what brands.
MS: Yeah. That's the <unk> When you look at the people you have to <unk>
MK: We have some places to go, <unk> <unk> <unk>
MS: I thought that <unk> meant we have a conversation outside the microphone.
<unk> the camera means "We don't want to know anything about your <unk>
MS: And so it was, one of these companies suddenly disappeared.
None of it wanted to have anything to do with this movie.
I was surprised.
They didn't want to know anything about this project.
And I was very <unk> I thought that the concept of advertising, was to introduce the product to as many people as possible, to make so many people see it as possible.
Especially in the world today this intersection of a new media and old media scenario and the stage of the separate media, is not the idea to tell you with that new vehicle that's worthy of attention that is going to lead the message to the <unk>
No, that's what I thought.
But the problem was, you see, my idea had a mistake -- and that mistake was this.
Actually, no, there was no such one.
There was no mistake at all.
This would have been okay.
But the problem was what this image.
You see, when you look for images of <unk> in Google <unk>   -- this is one of the first images that came up.
I like <unk> Sergey <unk> No.
This was the problem: <unk> <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> or <unk> easily <unk> which is characterized by the visibility or access to information, especially in the <unk> practices -- the last line perhaps the biggest problem.
You see, we heard a lot about transparency in these days.
Our politicians <unk> the president of the <unk> even the <unk> the <unk>
But suddenly when it's trying to make it reality, something changes suddenly change.
But why? Well, transparency gives <unk> --  like that weird bear that is still <unk>
It's <unk>   Like this weird rural path.
And it's also very risky.
What else is it <unk>
We had an entire bowl of <unk> <unk>
That's very risky.
When I started talking to the companies and to tell you that we wanted to tell this story and they said, "No, we want you to <unk> <unk> history.
We want a story, we want a story, but that <unk> <unk> <unk>
See, when I was a kid, and my father was going to get me into some lie -- and there he looks like he used to say, "Son, there are three sides in every story.
There's your story, it's my story, and it's <unk>
You see, in this film we wanted to tell the real story.
But with only one company, an agency want to help me -- and that only because I knew John Bond <unk> of many years -- I realized that I would have to go around my account, I would have to take the <unk> and go to business myself with all my team.
So what I started to realize -- and that I started to give you <unk> is that when you start talking with companies the idea of understanding your brand is a universal problem.
MS: I have friends who do big, big, giants and others who make small, independent movies, like mine.
And my friends who make a big, giant Hollywood movies, say that the reason that their movies have so successful is because of the brands associated with you have got to have.
And then my friends who are doing independent films say, "Well, how are we supposed to compete with these big, giant movies of <unk>
And the movie is called "The largest <unk> <unk>
How are we going to see specifically <unk> in the movie?
Every time I'm going to go out, every time I open my <unk> you see the <unk> <unk>
At any time during an interview with someone I can say "Are you good for this <unk>
Are you ready? You see you a little anxious.
I want to help you to <unk>
Maybe you should get a little bit of this before the <unk>
And there is one of these <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> like <unk> <unk> are going to have their opportunity.
We're going to have a lot of a man like a <unk> <unk> to <unk>
That's the general look.
Now I can answer your questions and give you a lot of <unk>
Karen <unk> We're a small brand.
So let's go back to the kind of smaller movies that we <unk> we are rather a brand <unk>
So we don't have the budget to have other brands.
So do things like this, you know, remind people to be the reason why this interest us.
MS: What words would you use to describe <unk>
<unk> is <unk>
KF: That's a great question.
Volunteer: <unk>
MS: Technology is not the way you want to describe something that you put in the <unk>
Man: We talked about a bold thing.
I think <unk> is a great word that actually puts this category in positive versus <unk> smell and <unk>
It keeps you.
How do we keep you cool longer longer?
Things like those who <unk> the benefits.
MS: And that's a company <unk>
What about me? What about a common kind of guy.
I need to talk to the man of the street to people like me, to the ordinary <unk>
They have to tell me about my brand.
MS: How do you define your <unk>
Man: You know, my <unk>
I don't know.
I like good clothing.
Woman: revive the 1980s, <unk> <unk> unless it is day of <unk>
MS: All right, what is the <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Man: I guess the kind of gender, I have to be like a <unk> <unk>
I like a lot of gray colors, a lot of gray colors, and things like that.
Usually I have accessories.
Woman: So Dan was a brand could be a brand <unk> <unk> <unk>
Man 2: I have the brand that I am, I would call <unk> <unk>
Woman 2: It's part of that partly <unk> partly <unk> -- I don't know.
Man 3: I'm the pet guy.
<unk> toys for pets in the country and in the world.
So I guess that's my brand.
In my small sector, that's my brand.
Man 4: My brand is FedEx because it <unk> the <unk>
Man 5: Now, sadly, <unk> failed.
Is that something?
<unk> I'm a <unk>
<unk> I'm <unk>
MS: Well, we can't all be a brand of Tom, but often I was <unk> at the intersection of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
I realized I needed an expert.
I needed somebody who could go into my head, somebody who could help me understand what they call the <unk> <unk>
And I found a company called <unk> <unk> in Pittsburgh.
They helped companies like <unk> <unk> <unk> to discover that personality.
If they could do it for them, you could surely do it for me.
<unk> <unk> the photos, right?
MS: Yeah. The first photo is a family photo.
A: <unk> a little bit about how it relates to your thoughts and feelings of self.
MS: These people shape my way to see the world.
A: <unk> in that world.
MS: That world -- I think your world is the world in which you think about as the people around you, your friends, your family, the way you live in your life, the work you do.
All those things come from, and they start in a place and in my case where they come from, and start in my family in West Virginia work.
A: What's the next one you want to talk about?
MS: The next is this next day of my life."
A: How does this relate to your thoughts, feelings and your way to be?
MS: It's like who would like to be me.
I like different things.
I like weird stuff. I like weird stuff.
A: <unk> from the <unk> to what does that mean?
What's the <unk> What is the <unk> What phase is the <unk>
Why is it important? What is <unk>
We have a little bit about that.
<unk> more than you, which is not who you are.
What other <unk> have you <unk>
You don't have to be afraid. What kind of Russian mountain, are you?
MS: <unk> <unk> Thank you.)
A: Thank you for your patience. A Great <unk> A: Yes.
MS: Yes, I don't know what is going to get out of this.
There was a lot of crazy about this.
<unk> <unk> The first thing that I saw was this idea that there are two different sides -- but let's go through your personality of <unk> brand Morgan Morgan <unk> is a <unk>
It was very well together.
And I think there's almost a paradox in them.
And I think that some companies are only focused on one of their strong spots or in the other rather than focusing on both.
A lot of companies tend to avoid the things that are not <unk> they avoid fear, those elements that are, and you actually make it become positive and make it become positive for you, and it's nice to see that.
What other marks like this?
The first here is the Apple Apple.
And you can see it also here at <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
Now there are <unk> <unk> and brands feelings, those things that have gone and come in, but a <unk> is pretty powerful.
MS: A <unk> What is your <unk>
If someone asks you to put your brand, your brand, which would be?
You're a <unk> person. You're somebody who makes the blood <unk>
Or are you rather a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
The attributes of <unk> are like being playful being playful like <unk> contemporary -- <unk> <unk> or bold like <unk> <unk> quickly or <unk> <unk> the magic or mystical like <unk>
Or are you more <unk>
You're conscious, sophisticated <unk>
You're a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
You're reliable, familiar, familiar, secure, sacred, <unk> <unk> like the Dalai Lama or <unk>
Over the course of this film, we had over 500 companies, <unk> and <unk> who said, <unk> didn't want to be part of this project.
They didn't want to have anything to do with this film, mostly because they wouldn't have control over the end product.
We allowed us to tell the story of the <unk> and we got to tell the story in this movie of how it now uses MRI to identify the centers of desire in the brain as well as commercial marketing as a movie for action.
We went to San Paulo where you've banned the advertising <unk>
In the entire city for the last five years, there is no <unk> there's no <unk> there's no <unk>
And we went to school districts where companies are going on the way in the schools with money problems in the U.S.
The amazing thing to me is that the projects that I've had the greatest response or the ones that I've ever interacted with is those in which I've interacted with things directly.
And that's what these brands.
They went to the <unk> they went to their <unk> and they said maybe these agencies don't have my best interest in mind.
I'm going to treat the artist.
I'm going to work with him to create something different, something that is going to be thinking about people, which is going to challenge the way we look at the world.
And how does it have gone? They had success?
Well, since the movie was released in the <unk> Festival let's take a look.
According to <unk> the film was released in January, and that's not <unk> we've had 900 million impressions in the media for this film.
This covers only a two-year period.
That's just in <unk> no press, no television.
The movie is still not <unk>
It's still not online. It's not in <unk>
It's not even presented in other countries yet.
Ultimately, this film has already begun to make lead.
And it's not bad, because almost all of the agencies that we talked about to <unk> their clients not to be <unk>
I've always believed that if you have a chance of risks, that in those risks there are opportunities.
I think when you bring people out of that you are pushing them to failure.
I think when you train their employees in averse to risk is preparing their entire company to be <unk>
I feel that what is going to happen to move forward is that we have to encourage people to <unk>
We need to encourage people to be afraid of the opportunities that can be <unk>
Ultimately, let's move forward, I think we need to give it a place to fear.
We need to put that bear in a cage.
<unk> the fear of fear.
From a <unk> at the time, we have to embrace the risk.
And ultimately, we have to support transparency.
Today, more than a little bit of honesty is going to go a long way.
And I said this, with honesty and transparency, all my talk -- the <unk> has been presented by my good friends for <unk> who were eating the rights of name in <unk>
<unk> <unk> big data in great opportunities for companies in the world.
<unk> presents the <unk>
Thank you very much.
June Cohen: So I was going to make it on the name of the transparency, that happened exactly with those <unk>
MS: It's a fantastic question.
In my pocket. I have a check on the name of the TED matrix, the <unk> Foundation, and a check for <unk> to be applied to my TED <unk>
The idea behind the <unk> computer worm is really simple.
We don't want Iran to get the nuclear bomb.
Their most active asset to develop nuclear weapons is the <unk> plant.
The gray boxes that you see are control systems in real time.
If we can compromise these systems that control speeds and <unk> we can cause lots of problems with <unk>
The gray ones don't use <unk> software -- it's a completely different technology.
But if we were able to put an effective virus of Windows in a portable computer because by an engineer to set up this gray, and we're ready.
This is the plan behind <unk>
We started with a <unk> Windows.
The <unk> enters the gray, <unk> <unk> and the Iranian nuclear program is <unk> mission.
It's easy, yeah?
I want to tell you how we found this.
When we started looking at <unk> six months ago, the purpose was completely unknown.
The only thing I knew is that it's very, very complex in the <unk> the <unk> used multiple <unk> <unk>
It seemed to want to do something with these <unk> <unk> these control systems.
So that struck us about it, and we started an experiment where we had the environment with <unk> and we saw what was going on with this.
So it was very strange.
<unk> <unk> as a lab rat who didn't like our <unk> the <unk> but I didn't want to eat.
I had no sense to me.
And after experiment with different flavors of cheese, I realized, and I thought, "This is a <unk> attack.
It's completely <unk>
The <unk> is actively looking at the gray box in the gray box if you find a specific configuration, and even if the program that is trying to infect is actually working on that <unk>
If not, <unk> does nothing.
So that called my attention, and we started working on this almost 24 hours a day, because <unk> "We don't know what the <unk> is.
It could be, let's say for example, a <unk> energy plant or a chemical plant in Germany.
Better than <unk> the goal soon.
And so we pulled out and <unk> the attack, and we found that I was <unk> in two bombs -- a small and a big one.
We also saw that they were very <unk> people who obviously had all the internal information.
You know, you know, all the dots I attack.
You probably even know how much they would have the operator.
So you know everything.
And if you've heard that <unk> <unk> is complex, and high technology, let me tell you, the payload is very complex.
It's very much above everything we've seen before.
Here you see a sample of this code of attack.
We're talking about about 15 thousand code.
It looks pretty much like the old <unk> language.
I want to tell you how we could find this code.
What we were looking at the beginning were called the functions of the system, because we know what they do.
Then we were looking at <unk> and data structures and tried to deal with the real world, with potential goals of the real world.
We need theories about tasks that we can pass or <unk>
To get to theories about targets, we remember that it's definitely a violent <unk> it must be a <unk> <unk> and it's probably located in Iran, because that's where most infections have been <unk>
There are not several thousand goals in that area.
It basically boils down to the plant of nuclear energy plant and the <unk> plant.
So I told my <unk> <unk> a list of all the experts in <unk> and energy plants among our <unk>
And I called them and I went back into an effort for <unk> their experience with what we find in code and data.
And it worked pretty well.
So we were able to associate the little digital <unk> with the control of the <unk>
The rotor is that mobile part within the <unk> that dark object you see.
If you run the speed of this <unk> they can certainly get rid of it, and even make it <unk>
What we also saw is that the goal of the attack was to make it slow and <unk> in an obvious effort to go crazy to the nest engineers so that they couldn't solve this quickly.
We tried to figure out the digital <unk> watching very close to the data and their structures.
So for example, the number <unk> it stands up in that code, you can't <unk>
I started looking at scientific literature on how these <unk> are built in <unk> and found that they're <unk> in what's called a <unk> and each waterfall contains <unk> <unk>
That had sense, there was a coincidence.
And it got better yet.
These <unk> in Iran are <unk> in 15 parts called stages.
And guess what we found in the code of <unk>
A <unk> structure.
So again, that was a good coincidence.
This gave us a lot of confidence in understanding what we had in our hands.
And so there was no <unk> it wasn't like this.
The results have been taken out after several weeks of hard work.
<unk> <unk> on dead ends.
And yet, we found that both digital <unk> would be a single one and same goal, but from different <unk>
And the little <unk> is taking a <unk> and making <unk> and <unk> and <unk> is actually communicated with six <unk> and manipulating <unk>
In <unk> we're very confident that we've determined what the <unk> is.
It's <unk> and it's just <unk>
We don't have to worry about other goals about <unk>
So here I show you some very interesting things that we saw -- really <unk> me.
There's the gray box there, and you see the <unk>
What this thing does is <unk> the values of entry values for example, for example, the pressure sensors and the infrared sensors and provides <unk> code, which is still running during the attack, with false data data.
And believe it or not, these fake entry data is <unk> by <unk>
It's like the Hollywood movies where, during the <unk> the security chamber feeds on <unk> video.
It's great <unk>
The idea here is obviously not only <unk> the operators in the fourth of control.
It's really much more dangerous and <unk>
The idea is <unk> a digital security system.
We need digital security systems where a human operator could not act fast.
For example, in a energy plant, when the big steam turbine is <unk> you must open the escape valves in a <unk>
And obviously this can't make it a human operator.
That's where we need digital security systems.
And when you're <unk> then you can go through bad things.
The plant can exploit.
And not the <unk> and the security system is <unk>
That scares me.
But it can be worse.
What I'm going to say is very important.
Think about this. This attack is <unk>
It has nothing to see, specifically with <unk> with <unk>
It could work as well, for example, in a power plant, or a <unk>
It's <unk>
And you have no <unk> <unk> that disseminate this burden with a <unk> key, like we saw in the case of <unk>
You could also use conventional technology of worms for <unk>
We would have the most possible.
And if you do that, with what we <unk> is with a <unk> of mass destruction.
That's the consequence that we have to face.
Unfortunately, the greatest number of goals for those attacks is not in the Middle East.
It's in the United States and in Japan.
All the green areas are spaces with a lot of targets.
We have to deal with the implications, and better than we start to prepare now.
Thank you.
Chris Anderson: I have a question.
<unk> has been public in many sides that people assume that <unk> is the main entity behind this.
What's your <unk>
Ralph <unk> Okay, really want to hear this?
Yeah. <unk>
My guess is that <unk> is involved, but the engine is not <unk>
The engine behind this is the <unk> superpower behind this.
There's one alone, and that's the United States, fortunately, you know.
Because, in another way, our problems would be even greater.
CA: Thank you for <unk> Thank you, <unk>
So I want you to imagine a robot that can carry on and give you the ability to make users or another one that makes users of wheelchair get a little walk.
In <unk> <unk> we call these robots <unk>
They are nothing different from something that you put in the morning, it gives you a big force -- that also increases its speed, and aid, for example, to manage balance.
It's actually the real integration of the man and the machine.
But not only that -- it can integrate it and connected to the universe and with other <unk> things.
This is not an <unk> idea.
So to show you now what we're working on, we started talking about the American soldier who, on average, have to carry on their back, a 45 load of 45 pounds, and it is <unk> to get more equipment.
Obviously this leads to some important complications -- injuries on the back, in 30 percent of the soldiers -- with chronic <unk>
We decided to consider this challenge and create a exoskeleton that I could help manage the issue.
Let me introduce you to the <unk> or <unk> Human <unk>
Soldier: With the <unk> exoskeleton I can give you 90 pounds on the ground for a lot of hours.
Their flexible design enables you to put into <unk> <unk> and run with great <unk>
<unk> what I want to do, or where I want to go, and then it increases my strength and my resistance.
<unk> <unk> We're ready, with our industrial partner to produce this appliance, this new <unk> this year.
I mean, it's a reality.
So let's go back to the users of coffee chairs on what I feel particularly <unk>
There are 68 million people roughly, in the <unk> around the world.
Like one percent of the total population.
And this is a really conservative.
We talk about something that happens very often, young people with damage in the column that when they start their life -- to the 20, 30 or 40 years -- <unk> against a wall and the wheelchair turns out to be their only option.
We also talk about the population that is going to be added rapidly.
His only option, many times -- for a brain injury or some other complication -- is the wheelchair.
And this has been this for the last 500 years, since its successful <unk> as I should recognize.
So we decided to start to write a new chapter about mobility.
So let me introduce you to the <unk> which is using Amanda <unk> who 19 years ago had an injury in the neocortical column, and as a result was unable to walk back 19 years, so far.
Amanda <unk> Thank you.
EB: Amanda is using our <unk> that <unk>
It's got some sensors ...
We didn't get rid of the crutches that they send signals to the computer computer here on the back.
There are a couple of batteries here that give power to the motors in the <unk> and on the knees, and they make it move with this soft and very natural <unk>
AB: I was 24 years at the top of my life when, for a strange jump in the air, skiing down the bottom is <unk>
At a fraction of a second, I lost all feeling and all movement from <unk>
Shortly after that, a doctor entered my room in the hospital, and he said, "You know, you never get <unk>
That occurred 19 years ago.
So he stole me to the last hint of hope of my self.
<unk> technology since then, has allowed me to learn to <unk> it costs the bottom of <unk> climbing rocks and even riding bicycle <unk>
But you haven't invented anything that allowed me to walk, until now.
Thank you.
EB: As you can see, we have the technology, we have the platforms for sitting and talk to you.
It's in our hands, and we have all the potential here to change the lives of the future of generations -- not just soldiers, but when we all the <unk> users of <unk>
AB: Thank you.
I just returned from a community that has the secret to human survival.
It's a place where women have <unk> practice sex to say hello, and the game is the day of the day -- where the fun is serious.
And no, it's not the Man <unk> festival or San Francisco.
Ladies and gentlemen, to know your cousins.
This is the world of the wild Bonobos in the rainforests of Congo.
The bonobos are, along with the chimpanzees, their living life.
That means that we all share a common ancestor, an evolutionary elephant, which lived about six million years ago.
Now, chimpanzees are known for their <unk>
But unfortunately, we've done too much emphasis on this way in our narratives of human evolution.
But the bonobos show us the other side of the coin.
Whereas chimpanzees are dominated by big, big, <unk> society is in charge of females with power.
These guys have created something special because this leads to a very tolerant society, where deadly violence is still not <unk>
But unfortunately, the bonobos are the least <unk> of the great <unk>
They live in the depths of the forest <unk> and it's been very difficult to <unk>
The Congo is a <unk> an extraordinary land of extraordinary biodiversity and beauty, but also the heart of the <unk> <unk> scenario of a violent conflict that has been prolonged for decades and caused almost as many deaths as the First World War.
No wonder that this destruction will also put in danger of the Bonobo.
<unk> meat, and deforestation is made that you can't fill in a stadium with the bonobos that stay in the world -- and honestly, we're not sure about it.
However, in this land of violence and chaos, you can hear laughter hidden in the trees.
Who are these <unk>
We know that as apes <unk> the love, not the <unk> because they have sex, because they have sex and <unk> to handle conflict and solve social problems.
I'm not saying that this is the solution to all the problems of humanity because the life of humanity is more than <unk> <unk>
<unk> like humans, they love to play throughout their lifetime.
Play is not just a <unk>
For us, and for them the game is critical to establish bonds and foster <unk>
And with him learn to <unk> and learn the rules of the game.
<unk> increases creativity and resilience and has to do with the generation of <unk> diversity of interactions, diversity of behaviors, diversity of connections.
And when you look at the sine game, you see the roots of the laughter, the dance and the human ritual of it.
<unk> is the glue that unites us.
I don't know how you play -- but I want to show you a couple unique videos from the wild.
First, it's a <unk> white ball game, and I don't talk about football.
Here is a female and a female male in the middle of a <unk>
Look at what's doing it.
It could be the evolutionary origin of the phrase, "I have a <unk>
I just believe in this case to him -- right?
Yeah.
So the sex play is common both in bonobos like humans.
And this video is really interesting because <unk> this video is really interesting because it shows the invention of bringing unusual elements of the game -- like <unk> and also how play requires trust and promotes the <unk> and at the same time is the most fun.
But play is <unk>
The game is <unk> it can take many ways, some of which are more <unk> <unk> maybe the place where the wonder.
And I want you to <unk> this is <unk> a young woman, who is playing with water <unk>
I believe that, sometimes we play ourselves, and we explored the limits of our inner worlds and outside.
And it's that playful curiosity that drives us to explore, interact. And then the unexpected connections that we form are the real <unk> of creativity.
These are just small samples of understanding that Bonobos give us our past and present.
But they also have a secret to our future, a future where we have to adapt to a increasingly difficult world with more creativity and more cooperation.
The secret is that play is the key to these abilities.
In other words, the game is our <unk> of <unk>
To adapt to success to a world that changes we need to play.
But let's get rid of the peak our ability to play.
The game is not <unk>
The game is critical.
For bonobos and human <unk> life is not just cruel and <unk>
When it looks at the least appropriate play, you can be the moments in which it's <unk>
So fellow primates, we accept this gift of evolution and <unk> together as they <unk> creativity, <unk> and wonder.
Thank you.
In New York City, I'm responsible for development of a nonprofit organization called Robin <unk>
When I'm not fighting poverty, we were <unk> <unk> as a captain of a captain in a fire department volunteers.
And in our city, where volunteer volunteers to a highly skilled <unk> one has to get to the site of the fire very soon to enter action.
I remember my first fire.
I was the second volunteer on the site, so I had a pretty high probability of going.
But there was still a career on foot against the other volunteers to get to the captain in charge and figure out what is our task.
When I found <unk> I was <unk> in a conversation with the owner that I certainly went through one of the worst days of his life.
We were in the full night, she was standing outside in the rain, and he was standing outside a <unk> in my pajamas -- while his house was in flames.
The other volunteer that I had just got before me, <unk> <unk> <unk>  came first to the captain and he asked him to go on and put it into the dog <unk>
The <unk> I was <unk> <unk>
There was a lawyer or <unk> of money that for the rest of his life, I would have to tell the people who entered a <unk> building in order to save a live to a living and just because I got five seconds.
Well, I was the following.
The captain made me a <unk>
He said, <unk> I need to go home.
I need you to <unk> the fire, and he brings this woman a couple of <unk>
I promise it.
It wasn't exactly what I hoped but <unk> I went on the stairs, at the end of the hall, hall, <unk> to the firemen <unk> that to that height or less had finished the <unk> and went into the main room for a pair of shoes.
I know what you're thinking, but I'm not a hero.
I took my payload back through the staircase where I met my <unk> and the precious door at the front door.
<unk> from the house for the home owner -- where, as he was to expect, his treasure. got much more attention than mine.
A few weeks later the department received a letter from the <unk> house <unk> by the brave effort to save their home.
The kindness that she watched for what else was someone had achieved even shoes.
Both of my calling in Robin <unk> like my calling as firefighter volunteer I'm witness to acts of generosity and kindness on a <unk> scale, but also of acts of the individual <unk>
And you know what I've learned?
It all has its importance.
So when I look in this room to people who have made it, or are for getting -- remarkable levels of success I would like to remind you of this. Don't hang on.
Don't wait for the first million to make the difference in somebody's life.
If you have a little bit of a little bit of to give, let's go back now.
We got food in a dining room, a neighborhood park.
Whether they're mentors.
Not every day we're going to have the opportunity to save someone else's life, but each day we're going to be able to influence someone's life.
So they trained the <unk>
Thank you.
Bruno Giussani: Mark, Mark, comes back.
Mark <unk> Thank you.
This may seem odd, but I'm a big fan of the concrete block.
The first concrete blocks were built in <unk> with a very simple idea, modules from a fixed measurement that fits each other.
Very quickly, these became the most used construction unit in the world.
They have allowed us to build things bigger than us, like buildings or bridges, a brick at once.
Essentially, these blocks have become the pillars of our time.
Almost a hundred years later, in 1947, to <unk> it came up with this.
It was called <unk> <unk>
And in a few years, the bricks of <unk> came to every home.
It's estimated that they've made over 400 billion or 75 bricks per person on the planet.
You don't have to be an engineer, to build hot bridges, buildings or homes.
<unk> made it accessible.
<unk> simply adopted the concrete block in the world, and it became a fundamental piece of our imagination.
Meanwhile, exactly that same year, in the Bell labs, the next revolution was about to <unk> the new building block.
The transistor was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of <unk> <unk> a few about others in a world where it was all interactive.
Just like the concrete block -- the transistor allows you to make much bigger circuits and more complex, a brick at once.
But there's a <unk>
I personally don't believe that the building blocks of our time are reserved for experts, so I decided to change it.
eight years ago, when I was at the Media Lab, I started to explore the idea of bringing the power of engineers to the hands of artists and designers.
I started developing <unk>
I'm going to show you how they work.
<unk> are electronic modules each with a specific function.
They're <unk> to be light, sound, engines and sensors.
And the best thing about it is that they're attached to magnets.
So you can't put it wrong in a wrong way.
<unk> have a code in color.
The green is the <unk> the blue is the stream, <unk> is the input and the orange color is <unk>
So you only have to assemble a blue with a green and very quickly, you can start to make bigger circuits.
One blue with a green one is making light.
Can we put a button in the middle and so we have a <unk>
If we change the button for a pulse, which is here, and now we have a light <unk>
And we got this <unk> to create more impact and we have a noise.
I'm going to stop this.
So beyond the simple game, <unk> are really very powerful.
Instead of having to be <unk> and <unk> <unk> allows us to program using very simple gestures.
To make it faster or slower, you just turn this button that makes your pulse faster or slower.
The idea behind <unk> is that it's an increasing collection.
We want all the interactions in the world to be transferred to bricks and <unk>
<unk> sounds, solar panels, <unk> everything must be accessible.
We've given the kids to see them playing with them.
And it's been an incredible experience.
The best is how they start to understand the electronics of every day you don't learn in schools.
For example, how does a night of night, or why the door of an elevator is kept open, or how a iPod responds to touch.
We've also led to the design schools.
So for example, designers without experience in electronics start to play with <unk> like a material.
You can see here with paper bottles and <unk> we have <unk> <unk>
<unk>  ago, a few weeks ago, we took <unk> to the designers of the Rhode Island School who have no experience in engineering, only in cardboard, wood and paper and said, "Do something.
Here's an example of a project that has done, a <unk> canyon <unk>
But wait, here's my favorite project.
It's a <unk> <unk> which is afraid of darkness.
For these not engineers, <unk> became another material, electronics became another material.
And we want this material to be all the way of all.
So <unk> has open source.
You can visit the website, download all the design files and <unk>
We want to encourage a world of creators, inventors and collaborators because this world in which we live, this interactive world is ours.
So let's go ahead and stuff.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about unexpected discoveries today.
I work in the solar technology.
And my little company seeks to get involved with the environment focusing on the environment.
<unk> collaboration.
This is a little clip of what we do.
<unk> Wait a minute.
You can take a little bit in <unk>
<unk> we can continue to leave the video on the side of a side.
No.
This is not ...
All right.
Technology is ...
Oh, I am no time for the time?
All right. Thank you very much.
A couple of years ago, I launched an initiative to recruit the best designers and technicians to take a year and work in an environment that represents almost everything that is supposed to be <unk> we asked them to work in government.
The initiative was called <unk> for <unk> and it would be like <unk> Peace <unk>
I would have a few members every year and put them to work with the <unk>
Instead of <unk> the Third World we send them to the wild world.
They made big <unk> worked with the <unk>
Their task is to show the possibilities of today's technology.
So meet <unk>
This is a hydrant in the city of Boston.
Here it looks like if I would find a quote, but what it really looks for is that someone is caught by the snow because it knows that it's not very good at switching fires when it's covered by a meter of snow.
How did it get to help us in this way so <unk>
Last year in Boston had a team of <unk> members for <unk>
They were there in February and at that moment it was very much last year.
They realized that the city would never wiped these <unk>
But one of the members called Erik <unk> I noticed something else: that citizens <unk> with <unk> the sidewalks right in front of them.
So it did like any good programmer, developed an app.
It's a nice application where you can adopt a <unk>
You accept <unk> when you <unk>
When you do that, you put a name, in this case, he put <unk>
If you don't do it, somebody can be <unk>
I mean, it has a component playground.
It's a modest app.
It's probably the smallest of the 21 applications -- last year.
But it does something that no other technology technology technology.
And it spreads individually.
A responsible for systems of <unk> to see this app realized that he could use it, not for snow, but for citizens to embrace <unk>
It's very important to work with these <unk> of tsunami, but people steals batteries.
So he asks the citizens to <unk>
And then Seattle decided to use it to make the citizens <unk> the <unk> <unk>
And Chicago is just <unk> to make people <unk> to clean sidewalks when they <unk>
So now we know about nine cities that plan use using it.
And this has been spread by <unk> and natural and natural way.
If you know a little bit of government technology, you know that this doesn't happen yet.
<unk> software acquisition takes a couple of years.
Last year in Boston we had a team working on a project that took three people for two and a half months.
It was a tool for parents to choose the best public school for their children.
Then they told us that I've done the normal channels would have taken at least two years and a half million dollars.
And that's nothing.
Now there's a project in the power of California that even the time has taken over 2,000 billion dollars and it doesn't work.
And there are projects like this in every level of government.
So an app that shows up in a couple of days and it spreads into viral form is a kind of a shooting warning to the institution of the government.
It suggests the best ways to work, not like in private companies, like a lot of people think it should be.
Not as a technological company, but rather like the own Internet.
I mean, without <unk> in open and <unk>
And that's important.
But the most important thing about this app is that it represents the way to address the question of government that has the new <unk> not as a problem of an <unk> institution, but as a problem of action.
And that's very good because it turns out that we are very good for collective action with digital technology.
And there is a very large community of people who are building the tools to work together with efficacy.
And it's not only <unk> for <unk> for <unk> but there are hundreds of people around the country that contribute to <unk> applications every day in their own communities.
You haven't given the government.
They feel like a great frustration before that, but they don't get rid of it.
And these people know something that we've lost in sight.
And it is that if we stop the feelings about politics, the row in the <unk> <unk> <unk> and all of those other things that make us crazy -- the government is essentially in the words of Tim <unk> "What we do together because they don't have <unk>
Now, a lot of people have abandoned the government.
If you are one of those people, I would ask you to do it, because things are changing.
Politics is not <unk> the government itself.
And because the government ultimately grows of us -- remember that <unk> the <unk> the way to think about it will affect the way to produce change.
I didn't know a lot of government when I started with this.
And as a lot of people thought that the government was to choose people to make people <unk>
Well, after two years I've come to the conclusion that the government is about all, about <unk>
This is the center of money and information center.
It's the place that serves the calls if you brand 311 in the U.S.
Scott <unk> this call.
<unk> <unk> in the basis of official knowledge.
It didn't find nothing. It started with animal control.
And he finally said, "Hey, you can open the gates of the house, put music good and see if you were <unk>
So it worked. So well by Scott.
But that wasn't the end of the <unk>
Boston does not have a call center.
It has an <unk> and mobile application, called <unk> <unk>
I don't have that application.
It was the work of the <unk> of New York City <unk> in Boston.
One day, this really came up with this <unk> <unk> in my bucket of waste. I don't know if it's dead.
How do I do it for <unk>
<unk> dynamic is different.
Scott was talking in person.
In <unk> <unk> it's all public, so everyone can see this.
In this case, it saw a neighbor.
The next report said, "I went back to the place, I found the bucket of garbage behind the house.
<unk> Yeah. <unk> Yes.
I turned the <unk> I went home.
Good nights, sweet <unk>
Quite simple.
This is great. It's the confluence of digital and physical things.
And it's also a great example of the income in the government for volunteer collaboration.
But it's also a great example of government as a platform.
And here I don't necessarily mean the definition of the platform.
I'm talking about a platform for people to be educated and help others.
So, an citizen helped another but here the government had a key role.
I connected the two people.
And it might have connected to government services for necessary but the neighbor is a better alternative and cheaper alternative than the government services.
When one neighbor helps each other, <unk> the communities.
If we call animals, that's a lot of money.
One important thing that we need to think about the government is that it's not the same as politics.
A lot of people do that, but think that one is the entrance to the other.
That our input system is the vote.
How many times have they chosen a political leader -- sometimes we spend a lot of energy to choose a new political leader and then we hope that the government to embrace our values and we need our needs, but we don't see changes.
That is because the government is like an immense ocean and the politics is the superficial layer of <unk>
So underneath this is what we call <unk>
And we say that word with a lot of contempt.
But it's that <unk> what keeps us that that is that we have to fund something that operates like something that operates at our against that something else, and in a result, we're losing power.
People think politics is sexy.
If we want this institution to work that we have to make the bureaucracy to be sexy.
Because that's where the real government works.
We need to collaborate with the machinery of government.
That makes the movement <unk>
You've got <unk>
It's a group of citizens concerned that have written a very detailed report of 325 pages in response to the order of <unk> <unk> about the financial reform project.
That's not political activism -- it's activism <unk>
And for the ones that we have <unk> to government, is time to ask us what world we want to leave our children.
You have to see the enormous challenges that they have to face.
Do you really believe that we need to go through the institution that can act on the name of all?
We can't afford government, we need to be more effective.
The good news is that with technology is possible to rethink the root function of government so that it can expand to civil society society.
There's a generation that grew up with the Internet and knows that it's not that hard to act <unk> you only have to articulate the systems in the right way.
The average age of our members is 28 years old, so I am, I am a larger generation of many of them.
This is a generation that has grown up by taking the word and giving that almost granted.
They're not giving that battle that we all face about who is going to talk, they're all going to speak.
They can express their views in any channel at the same time and they do.
So when you face the problem of government doesn't really care about making their voices.
They're using your hands.
They set the hands to the work to program applications that make the work better to the government.
And those applications allow us to use the hands to improve our communities.
It can be cleaning a fire hydrant, taking out <unk> dumping a trash bucket that has a <unk> inside.
Of course, we were always able to have <unk> those fire hydrants and a lot of people do.
But these applications are like a digital <unk> of that we're not only consumers, we're not only at least the government consumers that we pay taxes and get services.
We are more than that; we're citizens.
And we're not going to fix the government until you don't get rid of the <unk>
So I want to ask everyone else, when it comes to the important things that we need to do together, we will be a crowd of voices, or also we'll be a swarm of hands?
Thank you.
This is for me a real honor.
I've spent most of the time in prisons, jails and the death.
I've spent most of my life in communities that are living in projects and places where there is a lot of despair.
And being here at TED watching and hearing this stimulus has given me a lot of energy.
One of the things I've ever noticed in this short time, is that TED has identity.
And the things that are told here have impact on the world.
And sometimes, if something comes from TED, it has a sense and a force that wouldn't have a different way.
I say this because I think identity is important.
Here we've seen fantastic presentations here.
And I think we've learned that the words of a teacher can make a lot of sense, but if they teach feeling that you can have a special difference.
A doctor can do good things, if it's <unk> it can achieve much more.
So I want to talk about the power of identity.
I didn't really learn this at the practice of law, my work.
I learned it from my grandmother.
I grew up in a traditional family house, dominated by a <unk> which was my grandmother.
It was hard -- it was strong, it was <unk>
It was the last word in all of discussion in the family.
She <unk> many of the <unk> in our home.
He was a daughter of people who had been slaves.
His parents were born in slavery in Virginia on the <unk>
She was born over the <unk> and his experience with slavery <unk> the way it saw the world.
She was <unk> but it was also <unk>
When I was a little bit and I looked at it, she was approaching me and gave me a good hug.
I was so hard that I could barely breathe and then <unk>
One or two hours later, I went back to <unk> and he said, <unk> still feel my <unk>
And if I was saying no, I was going to tell me again, and if I was saying it was left in peace.
I had this human quality that would always wish to be near it.
The only problem is that I had 10 children.
My mother was the lower 10.
And sometimes, when I was going to spend a time with it, it wasn't easy to capture his time and his attention.
My cousins were running everywhere.
I remember when I was eight or nine years old, I woke up one morning, I went to the room and there were all my cousins.
My grandmother was on the other side of the room and looked at me <unk>
I thought it was a game.
And then he looked at her, and he looked at her, but she was very serious.
After 15 or 20 minutes, she got up, went through the room, and he went through the room, and he said, "Come on.
I remember this as if it was yesterday.
I'll never forget it.
He took me outside and said, <unk> I'll tell you something, but you can't tell <unk>
I said, "Okay, let's get <unk>
She said, "Now I didn't know it. I said, <unk>
Then I sat down, I looked at me and said, "I want you to know that I've been <unk>
And <unk> "I think you're <unk>
He said, "I think you can do what you <unk>
I'll never forget it.
Then he said to me, "Just want me to get rid of three things, you know?
I said, <unk> <unk>
And he said, "The first thing I want you to ask me, is you always want your mother."
<unk> <unk> is my <unk> and you have to <unk> that always <unk>
As I went to my mom, I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do it."
Then he said to me, "The second thing I want you to tell me, is that you will always do the right thing as though the right thing is <unk>
I thought about it, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do it."
Then, finally he said, "The third thing I want you to tell me, is that I never got <unk>
I was nine years old, and I said, "Yes, <unk> I'm going to do it."
I grew up in the field, in Southern <unk> I have an brother a year older and a sister a younger year.
When I was 14  15, a day my brother came home with a <unk> package I don't know where the <unk> grabbed my sister and me and we went to the forest.
We just had the <unk> of the usual <unk>
He took a sip of beer, he offered to my sister, she took a little and I was offered to me.
I said, "No, no, no. You're okay. You will <unk> but I'm not going to take <unk>
My brother said, <unk> today, and you always do the same thing as we do.
I already took something, your sister as well.
I said, "No. I don't feel good, you can <unk>
Then my brother looked at me <unk>
And he said, "What's up? Take a <unk>
And he went down with force and <unk> "Oh, not that you're still thinking about the conversation with <unk>
I said, "But what are you talking about?"
He said, <unk> tells all the grandchildren that are <unk>
I was <unk>
I have to admit something to you.
I'll tell you something that you probably shouldn't say.
I know this is getting <unk>
But I have 52 years and I can admit that I've never taken a drop of alcohol.
I'm not saying this to be a <unk> I say it for the power of identity.
When we create the right type of identity, we say things to others that really don't make any sense.
We can't get to do things that don't believe we can do.
I think my grandmother naturally believed that all his grandchildren were special.
My grandfather had been a prisoner during the <unk>
My uncles died of diseases related to alcohol.
And these were the things that we had to do with it, we had to <unk>
Now, trying to talk about our criminal justice system.
This country is very different than it was 40 years ago.
In <unk> there were 300,000 prisoners.
There's 2.3 million.
In the United States we have the largest incarceration rate.
We have seven million people in parole.
And this mass <unk> in my opinion, has changed fundamentally our world.
In poor communities, or black communities, it's so <unk> so much despair.
One of every three black hole between the 18 and 30 years is in jail or by parole.
In urban <unk> across the country, L.A., L.A., Baltimore Medical School, 50 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 to 60 percent of the young color are in jail or <unk>
Our system is not just distorted in front of race -- it's also about poverty.
In this country we have a court system that is much better if you're rich and guilty.
It's not <unk> but wealth that affects the results.
And it seems to be very <unk>
The politics of fear and anger will make us believe that these are not problems.
We're <unk>
It looks interesting.
We're looking at in our work some of the good curious.
In my state, in Alabama, as well as in other states, you know, <unk> for always if you have a criminal <unk>
Right now in Alabama, the <unk> of the black male population has definitely lost the right to the vote.
And if we projected it to the next 10 years, the level of loss of rights will be as high as before they let the law of the right to vote.
We have this awesome silence.
I represent children.
Many of my clients are very young.
The United States is the only country in the world that was passed to eight years to die in prison.
We have in this country jail for kids, without any possibility of coming out before.
Right now, we're in the process of some <unk>
The only country in the world.
They had people in the death row.
This issue of death penalty is interesting.
In a sense of sense, you've got to think that the final question is, people deserve to die by <unk> <unk>
A very sensitive question.
But you can think of another way about how we are in our identity.
There is another form of <unk> it's not about deciding whether people deserve to die for crimes <unk> but if we deserve killing.
This is interesting.
The death penalty in the United States is defined by mistake.
Of each nine people <unk> has identified an innocent one who is <unk> and liberated from the death row.
A <unk> rate -- an innocent rate of every nine.
This is interesting.
In aviation it would never be allowed to fly planes if every nine to <unk> you would have <unk>
But somehow we get rid of the problem.
It's not our problem.
It's not our charge.
It's not our struggle.
I talk a lot about these things.
I'm talking about race and this issue of if we deserve killing.
And it's interesting that in my classes with students about <unk> <unk> I'm talking about slavery.
I'm talking about terrorism, the time it started at the end of the rebuilding of the rebuilding and lasted until the Second World War.
We really don't know a lot about this.
But for the black Americans in this country, it was a very defined little <unk>
In many communities people were afraid to be <unk>
They worried about being <unk>
The threat of terror was what defined their lives.
Now there are older people who come up with me and say, "Mr. Stevenson, you teach talks, <unk> to the people who stop saying that in our history, we deal with terrorism, after the <unk>
They ask me to say, "No. Because we grew up with that."
The age of terrorism was obviously with segregation and decades of <unk> race and separation.
In this country we have a dynamic that we don't like to talk about our problems.
We don't like to talk about our story.
And that's why we haven't understood the meaning of what we've historically done.
And all the time we had one with each other.
We create tensions and conflict.
It costs us to talk about races. I think it's because we're not willing to engage with a truth and reconciliation.
In South Africa, people understood that they couldn't overcome race <unk> without a commitment to the truth and reconciliation.
In Rwanda, even before the genocide had this commitment, but in this country we haven't done it.
I was in Germany teaching lectures on death.
And it was fascinating because one of the teachers stood after my presentation and said, "Do you know that it's very disturbing to listen to what you want.
<unk> we have no death row in Germany.
We can never have it here."
The room was quiet and a lady said, "There is no way that with our history, we could never get into the systematic of human beings.
It would be irrational to us, and we <unk> and we gave us to run the people."
Let's get it on about this.
How do we feel like a world where a nation like Germany, <unk> people, especially if they were in their <unk>
We could not do it.
It would be irrational.
And yet, there's this disconnection.
I think our identity is in danger.
If you really don't care about these things that are so hard, the positive and wonderful things are, however, <unk>
We love innovation.
We are fascinated by technology.
We love entertainment.
But recently, those realities are <unk> by suffering, the <unk> the <unk> the <unk>
In my opinion, you need to integrate both of these things.
I've talked about the need to have more hope, more commitment, more commitment, more dedication to the basic challenges of this complex world.
I think that means spending more time thinking and talking about the poor, the <unk> that never come to TED.
If you think about them -- in a way, something that's within our self.
It's true that we have to believe in issues that we haven't seen.
So we are. In spite of being so rational, so committed to the intellectual,
And with innovation, with innovation, development comes not just about brain ideas.
These things come from ideas that come from their heart <unk>
This connection of the mind with the heart is what drives us to look at not only the bright and <unk> but also the dark and hard thing.
<unk> <unk> the great leader was talking about this.
He said, "When we were in East Europe suffering the <unk> we wanted all kinds of things, but mostly what we needed was hope, orientation for spirit, a will for being in places in despair and being <unk>
Well, that orientation for the spirit is pretty much at the heart of what I think even in communities like TED, must be <unk>
There is no disconnect related to technology and design, that allowed us to truly be human, if we don't pay attention to attention to poverty, to <unk> inequality, to injustice.
Now I want to suggest that these thoughts make make a much more challenging identity than if we ignored these things.
We go back to <unk>
I had the great privilege as a very young lawyer -- to meet Rosa <unk>
These women were just simply to talk.
Occasionally, I was called <unk> to go, <unk> comes the <unk>
Do you want to come and be <unk>
I said, "I am lady. Be <unk>
Then she would say, "Well, what are you going to do when you <unk>
I read <unk>
And so I went and just <unk>
It was a very <unk> <unk>
And on one occasion, I was there, listening to these <unk> and after a couple of hours, Ms. Parks ran to me and said, "Now, let's tell me that this idea of justice <unk>
You know, what you're trying to do."
And I started giving him my speech.
I said, "Well, we're trying to question injustice.
We try to help those who have been convicted of <unk>
We try to confront prejudice and discrimination in the criminal justice administration.
We try to end up with the sentences of life, without freedom <unk> for children.
We try to do something about death.
We try to reduce the population in prisons.
We try to end up with the <unk> <unk>
I gave all my best speech and the end of the end and he looked at me and said, "You know, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> <unk> <unk>
At that time, Ms. <unk> got <unk> he got his finger on the face and said, "It's why you have to be very much but very <unk>
I think actually, the TED community has to be much more <unk>
We need to figure out how to deal with those challenges, the problems, that suffering.
Because ultimately humanity depends on compassion for others.
I've learned some very simple things in my work.
I've been <unk> in simple things.
I've come to understand and believe that every one of us is higher to the worst of us that we have <unk>
I think that's true for everyone on the planet.
I'm convinced that if someone says a lie, it's not because it's a <unk>
I'm sure if someone takes something that doesn't belong to, it's not that a <unk>
Even, if someone kills another, it's not that a <unk>
This is why I think there's a basic dignity in the people who must be <unk> by law.
I also believe that in many parts of this country and certainly in many parts of the world, the opposite of poverty is not wealth.
That's right.
I really think that in many parts the opposite of poverty is justice.
And finally, I believe that even though it's very beautiful, very beautiful, very <unk> we don't judge for our technology, for our designs, not for our intellectual ability or rational.
At the end, the character of a society, not in the way as they treat the rich and powerful rich, but in the way they treat the poor, they <unk> their prisoners.
Because it's in this context as we started to understand truly profound issues about what we are.
Sometimes I feel <unk> I'm going to end with a story.
Sometimes I do too much force.
We got tired, like everyone.
Sometimes those ideas go beyond my <unk> in a major way.
I've been representing these guys who have been convicted of a lot of <unk>
I'm going to jail and I see my clients from 13 and 14 years old, which have been <unk> to be taught as adults.
And I start thinking, how can it be?
How can a judge turn to somebody who is not it?
The judge was going to make it as an adult, but I see a kid.
A very late night was wake up with me -- my God, if the judge can turn you into something you don't are, must have magic powers.
Yes, <unk> the judge has magic powers.
You should ask some of that.
As I was very late, I couldn't think correctly, but I started working on a <unk>
He had a <unk> customer -- a <unk> poor, black.
I started working on <unk> with a <unk> who said, <unk> for my <unk> black customer is treated as a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
In <unk> I found that there was been <unk> behavior in the <unk> in the behavior of the police and in the process.
There was a <unk> line about how in this country there is no ethical rule, but a whole lack of ethics.
The next morning, thinking that <unk> <unk> would be a dream, or really <unk>
For my horror, not only <unk> she had sent the court.
It was about two months, I had forgotten it.
And finally, <unk> Oh God, I have to go to court for this case stupid.
I got into the car and I felt really <unk> <unk>
I went into the car to court.
I thought this would be very difficult and <unk>
I finally got out of the car. He walked to court.
I was going up the stairs when I found a black man <unk> was the <unk> of the court.
When he looked at me and said, "Who is you?"
I said, "I'm a <unk> He said, "It's you <unk> I said yes.
And so I got rid of me and <unk>
And I got rid of the ear, <unk>
He said, "I'm proud to <unk>
I have to tell you now that that was <unk>
It connected deeply to my interior, with my identity with the ability that we all have to contribute to the community with a vision of hope.
Well, I went into the <unk>
When the judge saw me saw me.
And he said, <unk> Stevenson, you wrote this <unk> <unk>
I said, "Be me." And we started to argue.
People started there. They were all <unk>
I was the one that had written these crazy things.
You get the cops the prosecutors to <unk> the <unk>
Suddenly, I didn't know how, the room was full of people, every turn, because we talked about races, because we talked about poverty, because we talked about inequality.
With the eye <unk> I ended up seeing the <unk> which was going and <unk>
And I would just look out the window and try to hear all that <unk>
<unk> walking over here and there.
Finally, this old black man, with a face of concern, entered the room and sat behind me, almost on the table of lawyers.
About 10 minutes later, the judge had a <unk>
During the rest of a <unk> I was shocked because the <unk> had entered the room.
The <unk> <unk> on the old black <unk>
And he said, "Well, what do you do in the <unk> room.
And the old black stood up and looked at the <unk> and he looked at me and said, <unk> this room of audiences to tell this young woman to keep his view in the goal with <unk>
I've come today to TED because I think many of you realize that the moral arc of the universe is very big, but it folds into justice.
We cannot be really human <unk> if we don't care about human rights and for dignity.
That our survival is linked to others.
That our visions of technology, design, entertainment and creativity must be <unk> to the <unk> and justice.
And above all, to those of the people who share this, I just want to tell you that keep the view in the goal with <unk>
Thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: <unk> to hear and see an obvious desire for the audience, of this community, to help you do something.
Which is not a <unk> What can we do?
<unk> There are several opportunities close on.
If you live in the state of California, for example, there will be a <unk> this spring in which is going to be an effort to make it an effort to give us the funds that are spent today in punishment.
For example, here in California, you're going to spend a billion dollars in death row in the next five years. A billion dollars.
And in spite of this, the <unk> of cases of homicide -- not <unk> in <unk>
<unk> of rapes don't get to nothing.
Here's a chance of change.
This <unk> is going to propose that these funds would make the law, the law for safety.
I think there is a very close opportunity.
CA: There's been a huge decline in crime in the United States in the last three decades.
Part of the explanation, it says it has to do with the highest rate of <unk>
What would you say to those who believe this is this?
<unk> actually, the crime rate with violence has remained relatively stable.
The big growth in mass <unk> in this country is not by crimes with violence.
It's the wrong war.
That's why this is dramatic increase in the <unk> population.
And we let us convince for the rhetoric rhetoric of the punishment.
We have three legal causes to bring people to the <unk> chain, to steal a bicycle by little crimes against the property, rather than making them <unk> those resources to their victims.
I think we need to do more to help the victims of <unk> and not less.
It seems to me that our current philosophy of punishment do nothing for anyone.
I think that's the orientation that has to change.
CA: <unk> you have excited about here today.
You're very inspiring.
Thank you very much for TED. Thank you.
Announcer: <unk> the threats for Bin Laden's death.

Oh, my God!
Peter <unk> These are just some of the clips that I got in the last six months, <unk> could be the last six days or the last six years.
The idea is that the media means <unk> negative news, because our minds pay attention.
And that responds to a very good reason.
In every second of each day our senses is getting much more data than probably the brain can <unk>
And as nothing matters to us, the first stop of all this data is an old fragment of the temporal lobe called the <unk>
The amygdala is our early alert detector.
<unk> and records all the information looking for something in the environment that could make us hurt.
That's why a <unk> of stories would look at the <unk>
That old saying, "If there's blood, <unk> -- it's very true.
And because all digital devices give us negative news, the seven days of the week, 24 hours a day, it's no wonder that we are <unk>
It's not surprising that people think that the world is going to be <unk>
But maybe it doesn't.
Maybe, in change, what really happens is we get <unk>
Maybe enormous progress done in the last century for a series of forces is <unk> so we have the potential to create a world of abundance in the next three decades.
I'm not saying that we don't have our good problems, the climate change, the species extinction -- the scarcity of water and <unk> no doubts that we have.
As human beings are very good at <unk> the problems, and in the long time, we just got with them.
Let's take it in the last century to see where we go.
Over the last hundred years, the average of life has been more than <unk> average per capita income has been <unk> across the world.
Child mortality has shrunk 10 times.
Moreover, the cost of food, of transportation and communications, has fallen from 10 to 1,000 times.
Steve Pinker showed us that we're living the most peaceful time of human history.
And Charles <unk> that GDP literacy went from 25 to more than 80 percent to over 80 years.
We are really living an extraordinary time.
A lot of people do it.
And we keep <unk> expectations more and higher care.
In fact, let's make the meaning of poverty.
<unk> today in the U.S., most of the people living under the line of poverty have electricity, water, shelter, unregulated phones, air conditioning and cars.
The <unk> <unk> of the last century, the <unk> of the planet, would never have dreamed of such <unk>
It's a lot of this technology, and we have this exponential growth there.
My good friend Ray Kurzweil showed that any tool that we put in technology technology jumps on this curve, Moore's Law -- and doubling the price of the price for about 12 to 24 months.
That's why the mobile mobile phone is a million times cheaper and a thousand times faster than a supercomputer in the 1970s.
Now look at this curve.
It's Moore's Law for the last hundred years.
I want you to watch two things on this curve.
First, the soft thing that is -- in good and bad days, in the war and <unk> in depression and <unk>
It's the end of fast computers used to build faster computers.
It stops before any of the great challenges.
And even though it's <unk> on a law to the left, it curve goes up.
The growth rate of technology is more and faster.
And on this curve, to <unk> of Moore's Law is a series of extraordinarily powerful technologies that we have today.
<unk> in the cloud, that my friends in <unk> call infinite sensors and sensors and networks, the <unk> 3D printing and the ability to democratize personalized production across the planet, the synthetic biology, the fuels and the food, the digital medicine, the <unk> and the <unk>
I mean, how many of you saw the victory in "Jeopardy" from Watson, in <unk>
It was <unk>
I <unk> the best headline I <unk>
And I loved this: I was going to give you <unk>
"Jeopardy" is not a easy.
<unk> with the <unk> of the human language.
Imagine this artificial intelligence in the cloud, available for all in the cell phone.
Four years ago, here at TED, Ray Kurzweil and I, we launched a new college called <unk> <unk>
We teach these technologies to our students, and in particular, how can they be used to solve the great challenges of humanity.
And every year we asked them to release a company, or a product or service that can positively affect the lives of a billion people in a decade.
Think about that, the fact that a group of students can impact the life of a billion people.
Thirty years ago, I would have <unk> absurd.
So today we can point out a <unk> of companies that have done it.
When I think to create plenty, doesn't mean to create <unk> life for every single <unk> is about creating a life of the possible.
It's about taking that that is scarce and making it <unk>
You see, scarcity is <unk> and technology is a force that releases resources.
I'll give you an example.
It's a <unk> story in the <unk>
He's the guy on the left.
<unk> <unk> King of <unk>
<unk> troops were covered with <unk> and the same <unk> with gold <unk>
But the king of <unk> ate it <unk>
You see, the aluminum metal was the most precious metal on the planet, it was more than the gold and the <unk>
That's why the tip of the <unk> to Washington is aluminum.
You see, even though aluminum is the <unk> of the mass of the Earth, it doesn't come like pure metal.
It's linked for oxygen and <unk>
But then the <unk> came up and made of something so cheap that we use it as if it was <unk>
And let's make this analogy towards the future.
Let's think about energy shortage
Ladies and gentlemen, we are on a planet -- by 5,000 times more energy than we use in a year.
They get on the Earth 16 percent of energy every 88 minutes.
It's not about it, but it's <unk>
And there's good news.
This year, for the first time, the cost of solar energy in India is 50 percent less than <unk> by <unk> <unk> rupees versus 17 rupees.
The cost of solar power dropped 50 percent last year.
Last month, the MIT published a study that shows that at the end of the decade, in the <unk> parts of the United States, will cost six cents a <unk> per hour compared to the 15 cents of national average.
And if we have abundance of energy, we have water abundance of water.
Let's now talk about the wars in the water.
Do you remember when Carl Sagan wrote the Voyager spacecraft to the Earth, in 1990, after he passed on.
<unk> a famous photo -- how do you <unk>
"A pale <unk>
Because we live on a planet of water.
We live on a planet covered in a 70 percent of water.
Yes, the <unk> is saltwater, two percent is ice, and we fight for the <unk> of the planet, but also there is an hope.
It's a technology available not in 10 or 20 years, but right now.
It comes the nanotechnology, the <unk>
In a conversation with Dean Kamen this morning, one of the innovators in the <unk> I would like to share with you, you gave me permission to give up your technology called <unk> <unk> -- you know, <unk> is the size of a small apartment.
It's able to generate a thousand liters of drinking water to the day of any source source, saltwater, water -- a <unk> for less than two cents a gallon.
The president of Coca-Cola is <unk> that will make a major test of hundreds of these units in the developing world.
If that comes out right, and I have full confidence in which it will be, Coca-Cola is the world in <unk> countries on the planet.
This is a <unk> innovation for this technology that there is today.
And we've seen it in cell phones.
My God, we're going to get to 70 percent penetration of mobile phones in the developing world for the end of 2013.
<unk> that warrior <unk> <unk> has better mobile communications in the middle of Kenya that President Reagan was 25 years ago.
And to tell you with a smartphone with Google, has access to more knowledge and information that President Clinton is 15 years ago.
It lives in a world of abundance of information and communications that nobody could have predicted before.
And better than that, the things that you and I have paid hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars -- video <unk> video and music technology, diagnostic technology -- now <unk> and lose market value with mobile phones.
Maybe the best it comes to when your health applications come in.
Last month, I had the pleasure of announce with the <unk> Foundation, which is called the X <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're challenging the tools of the world to get these technologies into a mobile device with the ones that talk, and because it has <unk> they can be able to get blood from your finger.
To win it has to make better diagnostics that a medical team does.
Imagine this device in the middle of the developing world in which there are no doctors, where the payload <unk> is 25 percent, and there's <unk> of health workers.
When this device is <unk> a virus of RNA or DNA that won't be able to call the health and the first place, avoid the pandemic.
But this is the greatest force to produce a world of abundance.
I call it the <unk>
The white lines here are population.
So we've just spent the brand of <unk> billion.
By the way, the best protection against the demographic explosion is to treat the world of education and health.
In 2010, we had less than two billion people online, connected.
By 2020, it'll go from two billion to five billion Internet users.
Three billion of the minds never before we get to the global conversation.
What do these people?
What do you do? What do you want?
And instead of an economic collapse we have the largest economic injection of history.
These people represent tens of billions of dollars <unk> in the global economy.
And <unk> of more health thanks to the <unk> of a better education with the Khan Academy -- and because of using impressions in 3D and computation in the cloud will be more productive than ever before.
What can we put 3,000 billion more members of humanity, healthy polite and <unk>
What about voices never before <unk>
What if we give <unk> wherever they are, a voice to be heard and be able to act for the first time?
What did these three billion?
And if they're vital that we can't afford it.
One thing I learned with the X Prize is that small equipment, guided by their passion with a goal of course, they can do things -- things that could only make the big corporations and governments.
I'm going to end up sharing a story that really excites me.
There's a program that perhaps heard of it.
It's called <unk>
<unk> at the University of Washington, in Seattle.
It's a game where people can take a sequence of amino acids and figure out how they fold protein.
<unk> determine structure and <unk>
It's a very important thing for medical research.
And so far, it was a <unk> problem.
They have played up with this university professors, among others.
Then hundreds of thousands of people joined up and started <unk>
And it has shown that today the machinery of recognition of human patterns is better folding -- protein than the best computers.
Ladies and gentlemen, what gives me a huge trust in the future is that we have more power as people to assume the great challenges of the planet.
We have the tools with this exponential technology.
We have the passion of the <unk> <unk>
We have the capital of <unk>
And we have three billion new minds that are given us to work on the solution of the great challenges and doing what we should do.
We have in front of some extraordinary decades.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk about a very <unk> idea.
<unk> <unk>
And as the idea can be explained in a minute, before you give them three examples to make time.
The first story is Charles Darwin, one of my heroes.
He was here, as you know, in <unk>
You may believe that <unk> <unk> but it wasn't like that.
It actually <unk> fish.
And he described one of them as a very <unk>
It was the <unk>
He caught it a lot to the <unk>
Now the fish is in the Red Cross <unk>
But we've heard this story many times, about Galapagos and other places, so that has nothing special.
But the case is, we still come to the Galapagos.
We still think they're <unk>
The brochures are still saying that they keep <unk>
So what happens here?
The second story, it also illustrates another concept.
Because I was there in <unk> studying a lagoon in West Africa.
I was there because I grew up in Europe and then I wanted to work in Africa.
I thought I could <unk>
I burned very much with the sun, and I was convinced that I wasn't there.
This is my first exhibition to the sun.
The lagoon was surrounded by <unk> and, as you can see, from some mangroves.
There were <unk> of about 20 miles, the black beard, <unk>
And the fishery of this <unk> was very abundant and spent for a good moment, so he was made in the middle in Ghana.
When I went there 27 years later, the amount of fish had dropped in half.
We went back to the five centimeters.
We got a genetic pressure.
There was still fish.
It was still happy.
And the fish were still happy to be there.
I mean, nothing in changed, but everything has changed.
My third story is that I was complicit in the introduction of <unk> in Southeast Asia.
In the 1970s, I mean, it started in <unk> Europe did a lot of developing projects.
<unk> development was to impose to the countries that were already 100,000 <unk> <unk> the industrial fishing.
And this boat, pretty bad boat, I called the <unk> four.
I went out to fish on it, and we did studies in the south of the Sea of China <unk> and, especially in the <unk> Sea.
What we captured was a <unk>
You know, I mean, the bottom of the sea.
Ninety percent of what we captured were <unk> other animals that are in the background.
And most fish are tiny spots on a little bit of <unk> remains that are <unk>
In short, the sea bottom came to the deck and then was <unk>
These images are extraordinary because the transition is very fast.
In a year, you do a study and then you start commercial fishing.
The bottom line is a solid background of soft coral in this case, to be a <unk>
This is a dead <unk>
Not <unk> <unk> because they were dead.
We once captured a alive.
He wasn't <unk>
And so they wanted to <unk> because it was a good food.
This mountain of remains what they collect the fishermen every time they go to a zone that they have never fish.
But it's not <unk>
We don't remember.
We get the starting point, to the new level, without remembering what was there.
If you think of this something like this.
On the axis, we have things -- biodiversity, and we have <unk> biodiversity, and the <unk> of the country, the water supply.
And that changes with time. It changes because people do things with <unk>
Each generation will use the images I learned at the beginning of their conscious life as normal and the extrapolate forward.
The difference is that they perceive loss.
But they don't see the loss that happened before.
You can analyze the type of changes.
And at the end of the end to keep <unk> remains.
And that, in a great extent, is we want to do it now.
We want to keep things that are no longer what they were.
But you should think that this problem affects people when societies <unk> they kill animals without knowing what they've done to some generations later.
Because, obviously, an animal that is very depressing.
You don't lose animal animals.
You lose little animals.
Even if this is not perceived as a great loss.
Over time, we focus on big animals, and in a sea sea of great fish.
They become <unk> because the <unk>
Over time there are few fish, but we think that's the point of <unk>
And the question is, why do we accept this?
Well, because we don't know it was different.
In fact, a lot of people, scientists, <unk> who was very different.
And they will do it because evidence presented in a previous way, is not the way they would expect to have the evidence.
For example, the anecdote that some of the things we have as a captain of as a captain and such a lot of fish in this area cannot be used in this area can't be used by the scientists in the fishing, because it's not <unk>
So we have a situation where people don't know the past, although we lived in <unk> societies, because they don't rely on the sources of the past.
And from there the huge role that can make a protected area.
Because with the marine <unk> we really recreated the past.
<unk> the past that people cannot conceive of because the starting point has been running and is extremely low.
That's for the people that you can see a protected protected area and can benefit from the vision that lets you erase their point of <unk>
And what about people who can't do it because they don't have access, like the <unk> people in the Midwest, for example?
I think that the arts and cinema can be able to fill the vacuum. The simulation.
This is a simulation of <unk> Bay.
A long time ago, there were gray whales in the <unk> bay 500 years ago.
And you may have noticed that <unk> and <unk> are like <unk>
And if you think about it, if you think about why people were moved with the movie <unk> to talk about the story of <unk> why do you deal with the <unk>
Because it raises something that, in a certain sense, has been lost.
So my <unk> the only one I'd to give, is <unk> <unk> <unk> underwater.
Thank you very much.
Hello. I'm Kevin <unk> the <unk> <unk> manager and look at YouTube videos in a career.
It's true.
So today we're going to see why videos are doing <unk> and what importance does that.
We all want to be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> When I was younger, that seemed a very, very difficult thing.
But today, the web video makes any of us, or our actions, copper <unk> in a part of our global culture.
Anybody can be done famous on the Internet in a <unk>
You get over 48 hours of video to YouTube for a minute.
And of those, just a little percentage is a little bit of viral -- gets infinite and a <unk>
How does that happen?
Three things: Three things: of trends, communities of engaging and <unk>
Okay, <unk>
<unk> <unk> Oh, my God, my God.
Oh my God!
Wow.
<unk> <unk>
KA: Last year, <unk> <unk> published this film outside his house in the National Park of <unk>
In 2010, it was seen 23 million times.
This graph shows the <unk> in the peak of last summer.
<unk> didn't speak to do a viral video.
I just wanted to share a double rainbow.
That's what you do if it's called <unk> Mountain <unk>
There were already published many videos of nature.
This video had been published on January.
So what happened here?
Was Jimmy <unk>
Jimmy <unk> published this again."
<unk> like Jimmy <unk> present things and interesting and <unk> to a larger audience.
Rebecca <unk>  It's Friday, you have to start on Friday.   You all want to get the weekend in the weekend, the weekend.   <unk> on Friday.  KA: Wouldn't you think we could have this conversation without talking about this video, I hope.
<unk> of Rebecca is one of the most popular videos of the year.
You saw it almost 200 million times this year.
This graph shows the frequency of use.
Just like <unk> <unk> this video seemed to have came out of the nothing.
So what happened this day?
Well, it was Friday, it's true.
And if you ask for those other <unk> they are also a Friday.
But what happened this day on Friday <unk>
Well, I took a lot of blogs and many blogs started writing about it.
Michael J. <unk> of <unk> Science <unk> was one of the first people to make a joke about Twitter.
But the important thing is that a person or a <unk> group of trends embrace a point of view, and share with a wider audience, accelerating the process.
So this community of people who share this big inner joke and then start talking about that and doing things.
And now there are 10,000 <unk> from <unk> on YouTube.
Just in the first seven days, there was a parody for each one of the other days.
Unlike the <unk> entertainment of the 20th century, this communal involvement is our way to be part of the <unk> phenomenon, or doing something new with <unk>
<unk> <unk> is an animation with a <unk> music.
That's the whole thing.
This year you saw about 50 million times.
And if you think that's weird, you know that there is a three version of three hours that has seen four million times.
You saw this video.
And there are cats that saw other cats see the video.
But the important thing here is creativity that I woke up between the Internet <unk>
There was <unk>
Somebody made an ancient version.
And then it was international made.
Suddenly, we came up with a whole community of <unk> that made this from being a stupid joke to something that we all can form part.
Because today not only <unk> <unk>
Who could have predicted something like this?
Who could have predicted <unk> <unk> or Rebecca Black or <unk> <unk>
What script could have written that <unk>
In a world where two days of video comes up for a minute, only the only thing and unexpected can be <unk> so that these things have done.
When a friend told me that I had to see this great clip of a guy who protest against the <unk> to cyclists in New York, I admit I didn't really get interested in it.
Casey <unk> I was <unk> by <unk> because there are often obstacles that keep you properly keep you properly <unk>
KA: Thanks to the surprise and their humor, Casey <unk> made it five million to see and understand their idea.
So this approach is worth all the new thing that we do in a creative form.
And all of this leads to a big <unk>
<unk> <unk> What does this mean?
<unk>
KA: What does this mean?
<unk> <unk> creative communities, the totally unexpected, are characteristics of a new kind of media, of a new culture, where we all have access and is the audience that defines popularity of it.
As I said earlier, one of the current celebrities of the world, Justin <unk> started on YouTube.
They don't borrow permission to express your ideas.
Now we're all a little masters of our pop culture.
These are not the characteristics of the old media -- are barely the current media -- but we are <unk> the entertainment of the future.
Thank you.
This is not a <unk> story.
It's a puzzle that's still <unk>
Let me tell you about some of the pieces.
Imagine the first <unk> a man burning the work of a whole life.
It's a poet, a man whose entire life had been supported in the unique hope of a unit and freedom of his country.
<unk> as the <unk> come into <unk> faced the fact that their life had been totally in vain.
The words, for so much time -- and they can now give it <unk>
It was <unk> in silence.
He died broken in history.
He's my grandfather.
I never met it.
But our lives are much more than our memories.
My grandmother's never allowed me to forget his story.
My job was not to let that have been in <unk> and my lesson was to learn that the story tried to get it, but it was <unk>
The next part of the puzzle is about a boat at the dawn of <unk> <unk>
My mother, <unk> was just 18 years old when his father died, and a <unk> marriage and two little girls.
For her, life had been destined to be a <unk> task, the escape from his family and a new life in Australia.
It was <unk> for her that I couldn't do this.
And after a <unk> of four years that defies fiction, a boat was washed up to the sea as a ship of ship <unk>
All the adults knew the risk of the adults.
The most fear was the <unk> the rape and death.
As most adults, my mother was wearing a <unk> with poison.
If we were <unk> we would first take it my sister and I, and then she and my grandmother.
My first memories are from that boat, the steady rhythm of the motor, <unk> diving into each <unk> and the vast and a vacuum.
I don't remember pirates who came out several times, but they were <unk> with the courage of men on our boat, or the dying engine, and not being able to swim for six hours.
But I do remember the lights out of the oil platform in front of Malaysia, and the young man who collapsed and died, and finish the journey was too much to it; and the first apple that I tried given for the men in the platform.
No apple had then the same flavor.
After three months in a refugee camp -- <unk> in <unk>
And the next piece of the puzzle is about four women over three generations to make a new life together.
We set up in <unk> a suburb of <unk> class, whose population is composed of immigrant
Unlike the suburbs of the middle class -- whose existence was <unk> in <unk> no sense of the right.
The smells that came from the stores were from the rest of the world.
And the fragments of English <unk> were <unk> among people who had one thing in common: They were starting again.
My mother worked in farms, then in a car assembly line, working six days, double turn.
Yet, I found time to study English and get a title of the <unk> <unk>
We were poor.
And all of the dollars were <unk> and the <unk> <unk> in English and mathematics, they wouldn't mind what it was supposed to be <unk> that generally was <unk>
Two base pairs for school, one to hide the holes in the other.
A school uniform to the <unk> because it had to last six years.
And there was <unk> and <unk> on the <unk> <unk> and some <unk> <unk> again.
At home, where?
One thing is <unk>
I was accumulating and a voice that said, "I'm going to <unk>
My mother, my sister and I <unk> in the same bed.
My mother was <unk> every night, but we were <unk> on our day and <unk> the movements of our grandmother in the house.
My mother had to have <unk> all the boat.
And my job was to be awake until his nightmares was to be awake until his nightmares started to be able to be able to be able to be able to make it up.
She opened a computer shop, then I studied to be <unk> and he opened another business.
And the women would come with their stories about men who couldn't do the <unk> angry and <unk> and kids were trapped between two worlds.
They looked at subsidies and <unk>
And they created centers.
I lived in parallel worlds.
In one, it was the classic <unk> student with what I was talking about myself.
On the other, I was <unk> in <unk> lives, increasingly, <unk> for violence, abuse, drug and insulation.
But many of them got help over the years.
And for that work, when I was studying my last year of lawyer -- I was elected the young Australian young woman in the year.
And I was <unk> from a piece of the puzzle to the other, but the edges, not <unk>
As <unk> <unk> resident -- was now so <unk> refugee and social activist invited to speak in sites that had never heard of, and in homes that she had ever ever imagined.
I didn't know the <unk>
I didn't know how to use the <unk>
I didn't know how to talk about wine.
I didn't know how to talk about anything.
I wanted to retreat into the <unk> and the comfort of life in a <unk> suburb -- a grandmother, a mother and two daughters end the day as they did for almost 20 years, <unk> on the day of each one and <unk> <unk> the three still in the same bed.
And I told my mom that I couldn't do it.
It reminded me that I had now the same age that she had when she went into the boat.
He had never been an option.
<unk> said to me, and you won't be what you don't <unk>
So I talked about <unk> youth and education and <unk> to the <unk> and the <unk>
And the more frankly I was talking about it, more was <unk> to speak.
I met people on all the trails of life, a lot of them doing what they <unk> living on the border of the possible.
And even though I ended up my hometown, I realized I couldn't stay in a <unk>
It had to be another piece of the puzzle.
And I realized at the same time that it's okay to be an unknown one, new back in the scene -- and not just that it's good, but it's something that is being grateful, maybe a ship of the ship.
Because being inside it may easily mean <unk> the <unk> can easily mean accepting the assumptions of your <unk>
It took enough steps outside my comfort zone to know that, yes, the world is <unk> but not in the way we fear it.
They had not been <unk> they were <unk>
There was a energy there, an optimism -- a rare mix of humility and <unk>
So I went on my intuition.
<unk> to a small group of people who the motto can't <unk> was a <unk> challenge.
For a year we had no <unk>
At the end of each day, I was doing a giant <unk> of soup that all <unk>
It would go back to the night at the night.
Most of our ideas were crazy, but some brilliant ones, and we open up step.
It took the decision to move to the U.S.
And after a single journey.
My <unk> again.
Three months later, I had <unk> and the adventure <unk>
First of all, let me tell you about my grandmother.
She grew up in a time when the <unk> was the social norm and the local <unk> was the person who cared about.
Life hadn't changed for centuries.
His father died shortly after she was born.
The mother grew up alone.
It became a <unk> of a <unk> whose mother <unk>
Without the support of his husband, he caused a <unk> to <unk> and bring the cause she itself, and much more <unk> caused when I won.
You can't do it proved to be wrong.
I was in the shower in the fourth of a hotel in <unk> when she died, 1,000 miles in <unk>
I looked through the <unk> of the shower and I saw it stop the other side.
I knew I had come to <unk>
My mother called minutes later.
Days later, we went to a Buddhist temple in <unk> and we sat around their <unk>
We tell you stories and make sure we were still with it.
On the night a monk came up and told us I had to close the <unk>
My mother asked us to <unk> his hand.
I asked the <unk> "Why his hand is hot, and the rest of the body so <unk>
"Because you have taken your hand from the <unk> he said.
They don't have <unk>
If there's a nerve in our family, that runs through women.
Since those of us were and how life we <unk> we now can see that the men who have come to our lives would have been <unk>
The defeat was very easily.
Now I want to have my own kids, and I wonder about the boat.
Who might wish that for you?
However, I fear the privilege of the easy thing.
Can I give you a <unk> in your lives, a brave <unk> in each other, the steady pace of the motor, the vast horizon that doesn't guarantee nothing?
I don't know.
But if I could give it and see them -- I would do it.
<unk> <unk> and also the mother of so is here, in the fourth or the fifth row.
My story starts in <unk> about two years ago.
I was in the desert, under the <unk> sky with the <unk> <unk> <unk>
We were having a conversation about how nothing has changed since the age of ancient Indian <unk> "The <unk>
In those days when Indians we wanted to travel to a car and <unk> the sky.
Now we do it with airplanes.
At that time when we <unk> the great prince warrior Indian, he was <unk> it took a bow and a <unk> on the ground, she was <unk>
Now we do the same with <unk> and machines.
The conclusion that we took was that the machinery had replaced the magic.
And that's a lot of <unk>
Every time I felt a little bit more than <unk>
I was struck by this idea of losing the ability to lose and appreciating a sunset if I didn't have the camera, if I couldn't get my friends.
It seemed to me that technology had to allow magic, not <unk>
As a child, my grandfather gave me his silver silver <unk>
And this piece of technology for 50 years was for my most magic thing.
It became a golden door to a world full of images, and <unk> and <unk> in my imagination.
I had the feeling that the mobile phone, the luxury clocks and the cameras can prevent them out.
We took our inspiration.
So I was <unk> I came back to this technological world to see how to use it to create magic, instead of <unk>
<unk> books since the 16 years.
So when I saw the iPad I saw a storytelling device able to connect to the readers of the entire world.
You can know how we take the book.
Where we are.
You put the text with the image, the animation, and touch.
<unk> becomes more and more <unk>
But what does that ask us?
I'm about to launch <unk> an interactive app for the iPad.
It says, <unk> your fingers on each light."
And so --  says, "This box is <unk> I write my name.
And so I get a character in the book.
At a few moments I get a <unk> -- the iPad knows where I live out of GPS -- which is led to me.
My inner child is excited about all of these possibilities.
I've talked a lot about magic.
And I don't mean <unk> and dragons to the magic of childhood to those ideas that we <unk> of children.
For some reason, fireflies in a jar always turned to me <unk>
So over here, we have to have the iPad to release the fireflies.
And really, they light up your way in the outside of the book.
The other idea that I was fascinated by child was that a whole galaxy in a <unk>
So here, every book and every world becomes a <unk> that I drag into this magic device within the device.
And this opens a map.
In every single fantasy book, there have always been maps but have been static maps.
This is a map that grows, <unk> and guide you for the rest of the book.
In certain points of the book it is <unk>
I'm going to go in.
Another very important thing to me is to create Indian content and contemporary content.
These are the <unk>
We've all heard of <unk> and the <unk> but how many people outside India know their counterparts in the <unk>
These poor <unk> have been trapped in the chambers of Indra for millennia, in an old <unk> book.
So we're bringing them back into a <unk> children's story.
In a story that deals with current issues like the environmental crisis.
And talking about environmental crisis, one of the problems of the last 10 years has been that children have been <unk> attached to their <unk> not out to the outside world.
But now with mobile technology, we can bring our kids to the natural world with their technology.
One of the interactions of the book is this adventure in which you have to go out the outside, take the camera or iPad, and we collect images of different natural objects.
As a girl I had a lot of <unk> <unk> stones, <unk> and <unk>
For some reason kids don't do it.
So to regain this childhood ritual you have to go out and in an chapter, a photo <unk> a photo to a flower and then <unk>
In another chapter, you have to take a picture of a piece of cortex, and then you get it.
This is actually created a digital collection of photos that then you can put on the Web.
A child in London puts a picture of a <unk> and he says, "Oh, I saw a <unk>
A kid in India says, "I saw a <unk>
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photos that have been taking.
Inside the variations of connection between magic, the Earth and technology are so many possibilities.
In the next book, we have to have an interaction where you go out with the iPad and video on the video on and actually <unk> it sees a <unk> group that appear on top plants in the house.
At a moment the screen is full of leaves the screen.
And you have to make the sound of the wind and <unk> so you can read the rest of the book.
We go into a world where the forces of nature are <unk> with technology and magic and technology to come to each other.
We have the power of the sun.
We're approaching our children and ourselves to the natural world and that magic, joy and love and love that we felt through a simple story.
Thank you.
I'd like to talk to you about why many projects from <unk> <unk>
And I think, really, the most important thing about it is that we stop listening to patients.
And one of the things we did at the University of <unk> was <unk> to a CEO of listening.
And not in a very scientific way, she raised a little cup of coffee or you and I asked patients, family and <unk>
"How can we <unk>
And we tend to think that this is one of the biggest problems for what everyone all, or perhaps not all of us, but most of the <unk> projects, we have to listen to listening.
This is my scale scale. It's very simple.
It has a <unk> on and it goes down.
Every morning I was <unk>
And yes, I have a challenge as you can see.
I got the challenge of getting to <unk>
But it is so simple, that every time I was <unk> it sends my information to Google <unk>
And my doctor <unk> has access to him as well. So he can see what my weight problem is not at the same moment when I need care, or some urgency to that style -- but I can see it backwards.
But there's another thing.
Like some of you know, I have more than four Twitter followers on Twitter.
So every morning, I connect my Wi-Fi scale and before I get up to my car, the people start <unk> <unk> today, I think you need a light lunch.
That's the best thing that can happen, because it's pressure from the pairs used to help patients, because it could be used for obesity, and also so that patients quit smoking.
On the other hand, it can <unk> to move people out of their chairs and together develop some <unk> activity to have more control of their health.
From the next week being available to the next week.
This little <unk> connected to an iPhone or another device.
And the people would go from their houses, to take their blood pressure, to take their doctor, and share it with others, for example, for 100 dollars.
This is the point where patients assume a position, they come back to regain the control and to be ship of their own <unk> but it can also help us care about health care because of the challenges that we face, like the firing of care costs -- the <unk> of demand and other issues.
We have techniques that are simple to use and start with this to engage patients in the team.
And you can do it with techniques like this, but also by <unk>
And one of the things we did I want to share it with you with a video.
We all have checks in <unk>
Maybe we have our cell phones.
We know perfectly where <unk> <unk> are <unk>
Where are they all <unk>
And of course, we can find strings of fast food.
But where is the closest <unk> to help this patient?
We asked them, but no one <unk>
No one knew where to get the <unk> saves lives right now.
What we did was <unk> in the Netherlands.
We created a website, and we asked the public <unk> you see a <unk> for <unk> <unk> where, when it's open, because sometimes they open up in <unk> and other people are closed.
And more than 10,000 <unk> was already presented in the Netherlands.
The next step was looking for the app for that.
And we made an app for the iPad.
We created an app for <unk> <unk> to find these <unk>
And every time they are in the city of <unk> and someone <unk> can use your iPhone, and the next weeks will use your cell phone to find the nearest <unk> which can save lives.
And from today, I would like to present this one, not just like <unk> <unk> which is the name of the product, but also as <unk>
And we want to make it globally.
We are <unk> all the colleagues in the world, in other universities, to help us find and act like a center for the <unk> of <unk> worldwide.
Every time you're on vacation and someone <unk> can be a relative or someone in front of you, you can find it.
I also wanted to invite companies around the world that could help us assess these <unk>
They could be <unk> or <unk> people for example, to see if the <unk> that shows is still in its place.
Please go through this and not just improve health, but take control of it.
Thank you very much.
I'm here to share photography.
Or is it <unk> <unk>
Because, of course, they're photographs that can't take with their cameras.
My interest in the photograph was awakened with my first digital camera to 15 years.
I mixed with my early passion -- but it was a little bit different because by using the camera that process was in planning.
And when you take a photograph with a camera the process ends up when the <unk> <unk>
For me the photograph had more to do with being in the right place, at the right time.
It seemed like anybody could do it.
So I wanted to create something different, a process that would start to press the <unk>
<unk> like this: a building on a very tight road <unk>
But it has a twist.
And even though it keeps a level of <unk>
Or pictures like <unk> dark and colorful ones, but with the common goal to keep the level of <unk>
And when I say realism <unk>
Because, of course, it's not something that I can <unk> but I always want it to be captured in some way like photography.
And so you have to think about a moment to discover the trick.
It has more to be able to capture an idea that with a moment.
But what is the trick that makes it seem real?
It's the details or <unk>
Take the light?
What is the <unk>
Sometimes the illusion is perspective.
But at the end it is our way to interpret the world and how you can perceive it on a <unk> surface.
It's actually not about whether it's realistic but what we think is <unk>
So I think the foundations are very simple.
I see it as a puzzle of reality that we take different pieces of reality and put them together to create an alternative reality.
Let me show you a simple example.
Here we have three perfectly <unk> things that we can all relate to the three-dimensional world.
But combined in a certain way, you can create something that still seems like <unk> as if there was there.
But at the same time, we know that it doesn't exist.
And so let's go into the brain, because the brain doesn't embrace the fact that it really doesn't make any sense.
And I see the same process by combining pictures.
It's actually to combine different realities.
And the things that make a picture look realistic I think that these are those in which I don't even understand the things around us in our everyday life.
But when we combine photographs it's very important to <unk> because otherwise something else is going to look bad.
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules that will continue to achieve realistic results.
As you can see, these images are not very special.
But <unk> can create something like this.
So the first rule is that the combination of pictures must have the same perspective.
Secondly, the pictures combined must have the same kind of light.
And these two images meet with these <unk> were taken to the same height and the same kind of light.
The third point is to be impossible to distinguish the beginning and the end of the different images with perfect <unk>
It has to be impossible to see where the image.
Here's another example.
You might think that this is the image of a landscape and the bottom is <unk>
But this picture is totally composed of photographs of different places.
I think in the staff, I think it's easier to create a place that will find it because you don't need to put endangered ideas on the head.
But it takes a lot of planning.
And as I thought this idea in winter, I knew I had several months to get them to find the different locations for the pieces of the puzzle.
For example, the fish was captured on a fishing trip.
The shores are a different location.
The <unk> was captured in a pit of stone.
And yes, I even made red <unk> the house of the island of the island to seem more <unk>
So to get a realistic outcome I think we need planning to do so.
It always starts with a <unk> an idea.
Then you have to combine the different pictures.
And here every piece is very well <unk>
If you do a good job when you take the pictures the results can be very beautiful, and at very <unk>
All the tools are there and the only limit is our imagination.
Thank you.
Let me start showing you a slide on technology, very boring.
Please if you can <unk>
It's a diagram anybody who took from a portfolio of mine.
I'm not interested in showing you the details, but the general thing.
This is a analysis that we were doing about the power of microprocessors and <unk> versus power of the local area.
What's interesting about this is that this one, like a lot of other people we usually see, is a kind of a straight line on a <unk> scale.
In other words, every step here represents a order of magnitude on the <unk>
I'm going to talk about technology with <unk> curves.
Here's something weird here.
And that's what I'm going to talk about.
Please switch on the lights.
It was more intensity because writing on paper.
Why do we have technological curves on scales.
The answer is that if you draw them into a regular curve where, let's say, these are the years or some unit of time, and this would be any measure of the technology that I want to give you the diagram would look ridiculous.
It would be something like this.
It doesn't say much.
But if you look at for example, another technology, like transportation, on a <unk> curve, it would be very silly, we would see a straight line.
But if something like this, it gives you a <unk> change.
If the technology of <unk> transport technology as fast as we could take a cab and be in Tokyo in 30 seconds.
But it doesn't go to that rhythm.
There is no <unk> in the history of the technological development of economic growth that every few years advance of magnitude.
The question I want to make is look at these <unk> curves. We see that you don't keep forever.
It's not possible to hold this change as fast as it goes.
We get one of two things.
Or it's going to turn into a typical curve, I know like this until something completely different, or maybe I'll do something like this.
That's all it can happen.
I'm optimistic, so I think maybe something like this.
So we would now be in the middle of a transition.
In this line we're in a transition from what used to be the world, to a new way.
So what I'm trying to ask, and ask myself, is: what is that new shape <unk>
So why is the world going on the world?
The transition seems really, really confusing if we are engaged in it.
I remember the future happening in the year 2000 and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000.
This is a conference that people talk about the future, and we see that the future is still the year 2000.
That's all we see.
In other words, the future has been <unk> year after year, throughout my life.
But I think that's because we feel something is going on.
It creates a transformation, we can feel it.
And we know it doesn't have a lot of sense to think about 30 or 50 years because everything will be so different than extrapolate that we're doing today doesn't make any sense.
So I want to talk to you about how it might be, how could that transition be that you might be.
But to do that will have to speak a little bit about things that don't have a lot to do with technology and computer technology.
Because I think the only way to understand it is taking distance and look at the long-term things.
The amount of time I would like to do this is the time of life on Earth.
I think this picture makes sense if we look at every billion years.
So we go back about two and a half billion years when the Earth was a big sterile rock with many chemicals that are <unk> around them.
If we look at the way that these chemicals were hosted we give us an idea of how things happened.
And I think there are theories to begin to understand the origin of RNA. And I'm going to tell you a simple version of this, and that is that, at that time, there was just floating in the oil <unk> with all kinds of chemical recipes inside.
Some of those oil droplet had a particular combination of chemicals that made them to bring materials from the outside of the outside and then drops grew up.
And they started <unk>
In a sense, those were the most <unk> mobile forms -- those oil <unk>
But those drops were not alive in the current sense, because each one of them had a random recipe from chemicals.
And every time you have <unk> it <unk> a distribution of the chemicals that are <unk>
So every <unk> was a little different.
In fact, drops that somehow <unk> being better at the time of raising the chemical <unk> more and more chemicals and more <unk>
Mostly, they lived longer. They were more <unk>
It was a form of life, life -- very simple chemistry, but the things are <unk> interesting when these drops learned the trick of the <unk>
And somehow we don't understand these <unk> they learned to store information.
They learned to save information, which was the recipe for the cell -- in a special chemical called DNA.
In other words, we would think of this evolution without meaning, a writing system that allowed them to record what they were to be able to be able to do it.
The amazing thing is that that writing system seems to have remained stable since which evolved two billion years ago.
Our recipe, our genes have exactly the same code, that same writing system.
In fact, every living being is expressed with exactly the same set of letters and the same code.
And one of the things I did just for <unk> Now we can write things with this code.
Here I have 100 <unk> of white dust that I try to hide from the airport security.
But <unk> took this <unk> the code has the common letters that we usually use in this -- and I wrote my personal data into this piece of DNA and <unk> 10 to 22 times.
So if somebody wants 100 million copies of my personal card, I have a lot of all the <unk> in fact, for every person in the world and it's here.
If it was a <unk> I would have put it in a virus, and it would have spread it in the room.
What was the next <unk>
And the DNA was an interesting step.
This caused these cells to be happy another billion years.
But then the other big step occurred in which things were very different, and that was that these cells started to exchange and communicate information forming and communicating information in the way of cells.
I don't know if you know, but bacteria can exchange DNA.
So in that way, for example, we've evolved resistance to antibiotics.
Some bacteria found the way to avoid penicillin and the <unk> to create their little DNA with other bacteria and now there's a lot of resistant to penicillin because bacteria communicate.
This communication led to the communities that, in a way, they were together on it, and established a <unk>
It was <unk> or <unk> together, or whether a community was very successful all the individuals of that community were more and <unk> by evolution.
And the inflection point occurred when these communities became so much that, in fact, they came together and decided to write all the recipe from the community board together in a chain of DNA.
The next interesting stage for life took another billion years old.
And at that stage we have communities -- communities of many different types of cells working together as a living organism.
In fact, we are a <unk> community.
We have a lot of cells that don't act alone.
The skin cell doesn't use without the heart, or the muscles or the brain and so on.
So these communities evolved and produced more interesting levels that cell phone, something we call a organism.
The next level happened within these communities.
These started <unk> information.
And to build very special structures that didn't make more than process information in community.
It's the <unk> structures.
The neurons are the appliances that process the information that those communities are <unk>
In fact, they started <unk> within the community being the responsible structures of <unk> to understand and convey the information.
Those were the brains and the nervous system of those communities.
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage.
Because at that moment as <unk> learning was confined to the duration of an organism, and not the period of evolutionary time.
So a living organism -- for example, learn not to eat a certain fruit because he knew <unk> the last time he ate it.
That could happen during the life of an organism because they had been built by these information processing structures that have been able to have learned over hundreds of thousands of years for the death of individuals that ate that fruit <unk>
So the fact that the nervous system built those kinds of information structures accelerated enormously the evolutionary process.
Because evolution could now happen confined to an individual.
It could happen in the time necessary to learn.
But then, of course, the individuals found the trick of communication.
So for example, the <unk> version we know is human language.
If we think about it, it's an incredible invention.
I have a very complicated idea, an idea in the head.
I'm here sitting here emitting a few <unk> and, hopefully building a similar idea, vague and <unk> in their heads that holds some analogy with mine.
But we take a little bit of a complicated thing to make it sound -- into sound, and you make something very complicated in another brain.
So that allows us to start to work as a organism.
In fact, as humanity, we've started to do abstractions.
We now went through periods of the similar periods of organisms -- we would have our low-cost computer methods and information processing.
For example, the invention of language was a small step in that direction.
The computer <unk> the computer tape -- the <unk> and so forth, are the specialized mechanisms that we now built to handle that information.
And that brings us together in something much bigger and faster and able to evolve more than what we do before.
Now evolution can happen in time.
You saw the evolutionary <unk> of <unk> where it produced a certain evolution with the <unk> program in front of our eyes.
And now we've accelerated the scales of time again.
The first stages of the story that I told you took a billion years every one.
The next stages, the nervous system and the brain, took a few hundred million years.
The beyond, language and so forth, they took less than a million years.
And the beyond, like electronics, it seems to take only a few decades.
The process is <unk> I suppose <unk> is the right word to name something that accelerates its own pace of change.
The more changes, the faster it does.
And I think that's what we see in this explosion of the curve.
We see the process <unk>
But I get the life designing computers and I know that the mechanisms that work for <unk> would not be possible without the <unk>
But now design objects in such a complexity that would be impossible for me to be <unk>
I don't know that every transistor does that machine of connections.
There are billions of millions.
Instead of that, with the designers of <unk> <unk> we think about a level of abstraction, we put it on the machine and the machine that does something that we didn't do, it gets much further and faster than ever before.
In fact, sometimes uses methods that we don't even understand well.
A particularly interesting method I've been using the <unk> is evolution itself.
We put into the machine an evolutionary process that operates at the scale of the microseconds.
And for example, in the most extreme cases, we can evolve a program from a random sequence of instructions.
We say, "Please can run a hundred million instructions to chance?
You could run these sequences of instructions at random, running all these programs, and take those that most of you are going to do what we want to do?"
In other words, I define what I want.
Let's say that I want to introduce you numbers, to put a simple example.
So we find the programs that are most of the most people <unk>
Of course, it's unlikely that some random sequences of instructions, <unk> numbers, so none of them did.
But one, luckily, he could find two numbers on the order of right.
And I said, <unk> you could take 10 percent of those random sequences that you better did the <unk>
We get those and <unk> the rest.
And now let's go through it, the best ordered the numbers.
And let's go back to <unk> following a process of <unk> analog to <unk>
Let's take two programs, that <unk> children, who <unk> <unk> and kids would have the properties of both programs.
So we got a new generation of programs for the combinations of programs that had a little more success.
And we say, "Please repeat the <unk>
Let's go back again.
So let's get some mutations here.
And it tries to do again and bring it to another generation.
Well, every generation takes a few milliseconds.
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution in a few minutes or in kind of complicated, in a few hours.
In the end, we ended up with programs that have absolutely perfect numbers as well.
In fact, it's a lot more efficient than I could have written by hand.
If I look at those programs, I can't tell you how they work.
I've tried to try and see how they work.
They're very strange <unk>
But do the <unk>
In fact, I know, I have the security that they get the goal because they come from a hundreds of thousands of programs that were able to do it.
In fact, their lives are dependent on this.
Once I was going on a <unk> with <unk> <unk> and he takes a card and says, "Look at this.
It says, <unk> airplane has hundreds of thousands of <unk> that work together to offer a <unk> flight.
We know that engineering processes don't work very well when they get complicated.
So we started to depend on computers to make different design processes for different design.
And that allows us to produce things much more complex than the normal engineering.
However, we don't understand the whole thing that there is.
And in that sense, it goes in front of us.
Now we use those programs to make computers much faster and so able to run these programs much more quickly.
I mean, they <unk>
The thing goes faster and faster and so I think it seems so <unk>
Because all these technologies are <unk>
We're <unk>
And we're at an analog moment when they became <unk>
We are the <unk> and we can't understand what the hell are we creating.
We're at the tipping point.
But I think something comes behind us.
I think it would be very arrogant about our part to think that we are the ultimate product of evolution.
And I think that all of us are part of the creation of what it is.
But now it comes lunch and I think I'll stop here before I get paid.
I think we need to do something with a part of the medical culture that must change.
And I think this starts with a doctor, and that's me.
And I've spent time enough to allow me to give part of my fake <unk> in that.
Before I treat the theme of my talk, let's talk a little bit about baseball.
Why not?
We're near the end, the World <unk> is coming.
We love baseball, right?
The baseball is full of amazing statistics.
There are hundreds of statistics.
It's because of getting <unk> the <unk> talks about the statistics and we use them to form a great baseball team.
I'm going to focus on one of them and I hope that many of you know.
It's called the average of <unk>
And we talked about 300 from a <unk> that we <unk> 300.
That means the bat <unk> three of 10 times.
That means to launch the ball to the playing field without being <unk> and anyone who tried to launch it to the first base of the base -- not get to time, and the second base will be <unk>
Three attempts at 10.
You know what they call a <unk> <unk> in the Great <unk>
Well, really good, maybe the team of stars.
You know what they call a baseball <unk> of <unk>
By the way, that's someone 10 <unk> <unk> four.
<unk> like the legendary Ted Williams, the last player from the <unk> League of <unk> in a regular season <unk>
Now let's get this to my world of medicine where I feel much more comfortable or maybe less awkward, after what I'm going to tell you today.
Suppose you have <unk> and they're <unk> to a surgeon who has also a record in <unk>
So it doesn't work, right?
Now suppose that you live in a place, and one wanted to be wanted to have two <unk> coronary arteries and your family doctor derived to a cardiologist whose record record is 200 percent.
But do you know what?
She's getting a remarkably improving this year.
And his hits have been <unk>
This is not working.
But I'll ask them.
What do you believe must be the average of hits from a heart surgeon or <unk> from a nurse or a <unk> <unk>
KB:
And the truth of the issue is that no one in the medicine knows the hits of a good surgeon, of a doctor or <unk>
What we do, though, is sending them to the world, and I would find myself with the line of being perfect.
You never, ever make a mistake and try to figure out how to do it right.
That was the message that I knew when I was in medical school.
I was a <unk> student.
Once, a fellow in the high school said Brian Sachs studied to a blood test.
smell.
<unk> in my little <unk> in the <unk> residence at the General Hospital in Toronto, not far from here.
And I learned everything from memory.
From my kind of anatomy, <unk> the <unk> and muscle work, the <unk> of every artery that comes out of the <unk> diagnosis frequent diagnostics frequent <unk>
And I even knew the partial diagnosis about how to classify the <unk> <unk> <unk>
And as much more we get more and more knowledge.
And I was very well; I graduated from <unk>
And I went from the school school with the impression that if we were going to make everything, or the most possible, close to everything, because I would get rid of the mistakes.
And it worked for a while, until I met the lady <unk>
I was a resident at a university hospital here, in Toronto, when they brought the woman to the emergency service in the emergency room where I worked.
At the time I was assigned to the <unk> service.
And when the emergency room was going to go to a cardiologist to get to that patient here.
And I would report to the chief of <unk>
When I saw the lady <unk> I was <unk>
I heard a sound <unk>
And when the <unk> heard a <unk> sound on both sides, which is going to give me a heart failure.
In these conditions the heart will stop working and, instead of <unk> the blood goes forward, the blood goes to our lungs, these are <unk> and so there's difficulty to breathe.
And it wasn't hard to <unk>
I did it and I got to work in the treatment of the treatment of the treatment.
I gave aspirin and medication to relieve the pressure on your heart.
He gave him <unk> of water, so that it could eliminate liquid.
And in an hour or two, she started feeling better.
And I felt pretty good.
And that's when I made the first <unk> he sent her home.
Actually, I made two more mistakes in it.
He sent her home without talking to the chief of <unk>
I didn't get the phone or I did what I should have done, which was to call my boss and <unk> with him for the <unk>
And if my boss would have seen it, I would have been able to deliver <unk>
Maybe I did it for a good reason.
Maybe I didn't want to be a resident that will be a constant attention.
Maybe I wanted to be as successful and able to assume that I could take care of my patients without even contact with my boss.
The second mistake I made was worse.
When I send it to his house, I didn't pay attention to a voice in my inner side, and he said, <unk> is not a good idea. Don't do it."
In fact, I was so insecure and I asked the nurse that I went to the <unk> lady, "Do you believe it's okay if you go to his <unk>
And the nurse thought and then he said to complete <unk> "Yes, I think I'm right."
I remember that as if it was yesterday.
So it was that he signed up the high and the ambulance next to the <unk> they took her home.
And I went back to the hospital.
The rest of that day, that afternoon, I had a bad <unk> in the stomach.
But I went on with my work.
At the end of the day, I was able to leave the hospital and I walked into the parking lot where my car was going to go home. At that moment I did something I don't do normally, I don't normally do it.
It went through the emergency room at home.
And there another nurse, not that the <unk> lady before, but another one, he told me three words, those three words that most emergency emergency doctors.
Other specialists are afraid too, but there is a <unk> in <unk> and it's that we see patients <unk>
three words are: Does you?
"It was remembers the patient who sent his <unk>
I asked the other nurse with total <unk>
And she said, "Well, she <unk> with the same tone of voice.
She was okay.
But I went back and on the edge of the death.
By an hour of time he came to his house, after I was given the tall he had an collapse and his family called the <unk> the ambulance brought into the emergency room with a little blood pressure of 50 millimeters -- which means a shock to severe, which means a severe severe.
I just just breathe and blue.
The emergency staff would be <unk> all their resources.
They gave them medication to raise your blood pressure.
And they put a <unk>
I was <unk> and <unk> to the core.
He had a mixture of feelings because after the <unk> was in intensive care, and he was waiting for all hope that he <unk>
And in the two or three days the next few days it was never <unk>
He had permanent brain damage.
The family got together.
And in eight or nine days, it was given to what was happening.
And the ninth day, he stopped to go. Mrs. <unk> wife, mother and grandmother.
They say they never forget the names of those who die.
That was my first experience.
And the weeks before that, I was struck by that, and I experienced for the first time the <unk> shame that exists in our medical culture, and I sat alone without feeling that healthy shame because you can't afford with your colleagues.
You make peace and you never get that mistake.
It's that shame that leaves a teaching.
<unk> <unk> that I talk about is what makes us feel very <unk>
It's the one that tells us not that what we did was wrong, but we're bad.
And that meant it.
And it wasn't for my <unk> he was a <unk>
I talked to the family and I'm sure I would get the things out and made sure that I didn't get paid.
And I kept throwing those questions.
Why didn't I ask my <unk> Why sent it to her home?
And in my worst <unk> why made a mistake so <unk>
Why chose medicine?
Little at a little bit of that feeling was <unk>
And I started feeling better.
And on one day <unk> was opened up the sky and finally came out the sun, and I wondered if I felt better again.
And I did a deal with me in which if I was going to make the efforts to be perfect in order to make more errors, I would cease to fill those voices.
And it did.
I went back to work.
But it came back to happen.
Two years later, I was an assistant, in the emergency department in a community hospital in Northern Toronto, and I got to a <unk> man with a pain in the <unk>
I was very busy and <unk>
And he pointed out here.
I watched his throat, I was a little <unk>
He sent it back to his home.
But while he ran to the door was still pointing out his <unk>
Two days later, when I came to make my guard, my chief asked to speak to me in his office.
And he made three words: it remembers you?
Remember the patient who saw by a pain in the <unk>
He came back and I didn't have a <unk> <unk>
He had a potentially deadly condition called <unk>
You can read it on Google. It's an infection, not about the throat, but it can cause the side of those tracks.
He fortunately, he didn't die.
You get antibiotics in this way, <unk> and recovered in the few days.
And I went through the same period of shame and <unk> then I went back to work, until it happened over and over again, and over again.
Two times in the same <unk> <unk> not <unk>
And it's a great effort, especially to work in a hospital, because we had 14 patients at the same time.
But in both cases, I didn't send it home and I don't think it's been a <unk>
One of them thought he had a calculation of <unk>
I was <unk> a <unk> but it turned out, a colleague of mine, a colleague who was checking the patient -- I would have a certain sensitivity in the bottom left, and he called the surgeon.
The other patient was a lot of diarrhea.
And I read the liquid order for <unk> and I asked my colleague that he <unk>
I looked at it and when you see a bit of sensitivity on the bottom right-hand corner called the surgeon.
Both of them were operated and they recovered well.
But every case, I was <unk>
But I'd like to tell you I made the worst mistakes in the first five years of exercise, and as a lot of colleagues say, is a <unk>
The most meaningful ones have been over the last five years.
We have embarrassed and without support.
And here's the problem: if I can't tell you and talk about my mistakes, if I can't find the <unk> that tells me what really happens, how do I share this with my <unk>
How do you teach them to make the same <unk>
If I could go into a place like this, I would have no idea what you think about me.
When was the last time you heard somebody talking about failure, after failure, after failure?
Of course in a party you'll hear talking about other doctors, but you won't hear someone talking about their own mistakes.
And if I knew and my colleagues also, like a <unk> in my hospital -- the wrong leg -- you believe I would have a hard time to look at the eyes.
This is the system that we have.
The total denial of mistakes.
It's the system where there are two <unk> the ones that make mistakes and the ones that didn't sleep and the ones that I know, those who have <unk> outcomes and the ones that have great results.
And it's almost like a <unk> reaction that they start to attack that person.
We have the idea that if we get to medicine to the people who make mistakes, we get a safe system.
But that brings two problems.
In 20 years of diffusion and medical journalism, I've done a personal study of bad medical <unk> and mistakes in order to learn how possible, from the first article that I wrote for the Toronto <unk> <unk> Black <unk> Black <unk> white art.
And what I learned is that mistakes are <unk>
We work in a system where mistakes happens every single 10 medicines in the hospital are wrong, or the <unk> is not correct. In a system where infection is increasingly more and more <unk> causing chaos and death.
In this country -- 24 <unk> <unk> by medical physicians.
The American Medical Institute established 100,000.
In both cases, it's about <unk> <unk> because we're not <unk> the problem as we should.
And that's what things are.
A <unk> system where knowledge is going to spread every two or three years, and we don't get paid.
<unk> sleep <unk>
And we can't get rid of it.
We have cognitive biases that allow a perfect history of a patient with pain on the chest.
Now, let's take the same patient with a chest pain in your chest, comes <unk> with <unk> eyes, and from breath to alcohol and, suddenly my story was <unk> in contempt.
It's not the same story.
I'm not a <unk> I don't do things always the same.
And my patients are not cars. They don't get their symptoms always in the same way.
All of this, mistakes are inevitable.
So if we take the system like <unk> and we remove all the professional professionals to error, well, you will not be anyone.
And with respect to people don't want to talk about their most <unk>
In my <unk> white, white art, it's already a custom -- to say, "This is my worst <unk> I would tell everybody, from the <unk> to the head of laparoscopic surgery, this is my worst <unk> blah blah blah blah blah. What are your <unk> and <unk> the microphone into them.
And their students were <unk> <unk> and <unk> saliva and started telling their stories.
They want to tell their stories, they want to share them.
You can say, "Look, they don't make the same <unk>
They need a context where we can do it.
They need a strong medical culture.
And it starts with a doctor every time.
The <unk> <unk> is human, they know human, they accept it, and it's not really proud of their mistakes, but it was trying to learn about what happened to teach others.
They took their experiences with them.
It's support for those who talk about their mistakes.
They would have the mistakes of other people not with the intention of <unk> but a loving way, and of support for everyone to be <unk>
And it works in a medical culture that recognizes human beings run the system, and when this happens, they make mistakes in time.
My name is Brian <unk>
I'm a <unk>
I am human, <unk> mistakes.
And I feel so much but I have effort to learn something that can convey to others.
I don't know what about me, but I can live with that.
And let me conclude with three words <unk> I remember that.
Do you know how many choices we take a day <unk>
Do you know how much we choose in a week?
I recently made a survey over 2,000 people and the average amount of choices that he says to pick an American, it's about 70 to a day.
It doesn't do much, in a research week at a week to a group of presidents in companies.
The researchers recorded the different tasks of <unk> by these executives and the time that we were able to make decisions related to those tasks.
They found that on average, <unk> <unk> <unk> jobs.
Naturally, every work included a lot of <unk>
Half of those decisions took nine minutes or less.
Only 12 percent required an hour or more of their time.
Now think about your election.
Do you know how many of you belong to the category of nine minutes, and how many of the <unk>
How do you figure it out, how do you deal with those decisions?
So today, I want to talk about one of the biggest problems of <unk> choosing to the food overload of choices.
I want to talk about the problem and some possible solutions.
As I talk about this, I'm going to ask you a few questions and I need to know your answers.
When I do a question, like I'm blind, like I'm blind, just if you want to burn calories.
In other ways, when you do a question, if your answer is positive for please give a <unk>
And now my first question on the day, are ready to hear about the <unk> <unk> problem.
Thank you.
Being a graduate student at the University of Stanford, <unk> this very, very <unk> supermarket at least in that time was very sophisticated.
His name was <unk>
It was almost like going to an amusement park.
There was like 250 different kinds of mustard and <unk> more than 500 different kinds of fruits and vegetables and about 25 of the water water, and this was when we got water from tap.
I loved going to that store, but on one occasion I asked me, why do I ever buy anything?
This is the shelf <unk> oil.
They had more than 75 different classes, including the ones that were in the <unk> box that came from <unk> trees.
I once decided to visit the manager and asked him, "Do well this strategy to offer all these <unk>
He pointed to me the buses full of tourists that came every day, usually with their cameras.
We decided to do a little experiment with the <unk> This is the <unk>
hall.
They had a different classes.
It was a shot for <unk> right at the shop.
We put out of six <unk> or 24 different flavors -- different flavors and looked at two things: First, what case people were willing to stop stopping the <unk>
More people stopped when there was a <unk> that when there was only six, about 40 percent.
We also looked at what case they were more likely to buy an empty <unk>
Here's the opposite effect.
From those who stopped when there was only three percent of the three had been able to buy <unk>
When there were six, we saw that 30 percent bought <unk>
If we do the calculations, people had six times more likely to buy <unk> if they were six.
Well, to decide that we don't buy <unk> we probably have a lot less good to conserve the <unk> but it turns out that the problem of choices are affecting us in good decisions.
We decided to do not to decide, even when this is not <unk>
Now the issue of the day, the financial savings is.
I'm going to describe to you a study that I did with <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> where we look at the decisions about savings for about a million Americans, from between 650 plans in this country.
We were interested in looking at the number of funds available for savings for retirement, for retirement, <unk> program <unk> people to save for the future.
And we found that there was a <unk>
We had <unk> that went from two, to 59 different options.
We found that the bigger the number of hedge funds had less participation.
So if we look at extreme ends, we see that in the plans that offer two funds, the rate of participation was 70 or more, not as high as they wanted.
And in the plans for about 60 funds, the rate of participation went back to the 1960s.
It turns out even if you decide to participate, when there is more choices, even in that case, there is negative consequences.
So to the ones that they decided to participate, the bigger it was the number of choices, most people are <unk> to avoid their actions or hedge funds.
As the more choices, they were more willing to invest in financial account of market.
But none of these extreme decisions are the ones that we have to optimize to optimize the social well-being future.
In the previous decade, we've seen three major negative consequences to offer more and more possibilities.
The most likely it is that we <unk> the decision, that the <unk> even when this goes against self-interest.
It's more likely to take the worst <unk> in finance and health.
You're more likely to pick things less than -- but you notice it will be better.
The main reason is that <unk> with looking at that giant variety of <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> but we are not able to do the calculations for <unk> contrast and choice of that awesome <unk>
I want to propose to you today -- four simple techniques that we have <unk> in a form or another, in different research, so you can test in their business.
The first is, <unk>
You've heard it before, but it's never been more true than today, which is more.
People always bother when I say, <unk>
They care about losing space in <unk>
But actually what we're looking at more and more is that if you decide to cut, get rid of odd options, there will be a rise at sales -- <unk> costs -- there will be a better experience in choice.
When <unk> & <unk> went from 26 different kinds of <unk> & <unk> to 15, you saw 10 percent increase in sales.
When the corporation Golden <unk> eliminated the products to supply the name of cats that are less <unk> -- they got the <unk> in <unk> for two <unk> largest sales and under the cost.
It knows that supermarkets, on average, they offer 45,000 products.
In a Walmart store is about 100,000 products.
But the ninth store in the world is <unk> and it offers only 1,400 <unk> a kind of tomato sauce away.
In the financial savings world, I think one of the best examples that have emerged about how choices is the <unk> of David <unk> the <unk> program.
All of the Harvard employees are automatically <unk> to a security fund of life.
Those who really want to choose -- they give them 20 funds, not 300 or more.
You know that people often say, "I don't know how to <unk>
They're all <unk> choices.
The first thing I do is ask the <unk> <unk> the differences there are among those options.
And if your employees can't afford to, either.
This afternoon, before I started this session, I was chatting with <unk>
He told me that I would be willing to offer people in this audience on a holiday with all paid to the most beautiful road in the world.
Here, a <unk>
I want you to read it.
I'm going to leave a few seconds to <unk> and then I want you to give up if you're ready to take the supply of <unk>
<unk> Okay. Anybody who's ready to accept the deal.
They're not more?
Well, I'm going to show you something else.
You knew there was a trick.
Who's ready for that <unk>
I think I really got to hear more hands.
All right.
You actually had more information in the first turn, than in the second turn, but I can tell you that they thought the second time it was more real.
Because the images would make it happen.
This brings me to the second technique to handle the problem of the food overload which is <unk>
For people to understand differences between choices, have to understand the consequences of each option, and that the consequences must feel very <unk> very <unk>
Why is people spend 15 to 30 percent more on average when they use debit cards when they use debit cards that when you use a thousand <unk>
Because it doesn't seem real money.
It turns out that making it look more real, it can be a very positive tool for people to get more.
We did a study with <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who worked in <unk> these people were in a meeting where they were <unk> to a <unk> plan.
And in that meeting that <unk> exactly like <unk> we did a little <unk>
What we added was that we applied to the staff that would think of the positive things that they would <unk> in their lives if they save more money.
With this <unk> there was an increase in the <unk> of 20 and an increase in the amount that they were interested in saving or what they wanted to place in their <unk> accounts of <unk>
The third technique is <unk>
We can handle more categories than options.
For example, this is a study that we did in a magazine <unk>
We saw that in supermarkets, <unk> throughout the <unk> corridor the exhibition of magazines can contain from <unk> different types to <unk>
But you know?
Because the <unk> tells me how to <unk>
These are two exhibitions of <unk>
One is called <unk> and the other, <unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> I'll give you a <unk>
<unk>
If you think the one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> I'll give you a <unk>
Well, something else.
It turns out it's right.
The one on the left is <unk> and the one on the right is <unk> But you know what?
This <unk> scheme is completely useless.
The categories must tell you something to <unk> not the <unk>
You often see this problem with those huge lists of funds.
I am supposed to be <unk>
My fourth <unk> <unk> <unk>
It turns out that we can handle a lot more information than we think about -- if just a little bit.
We need to increase the complexity.
I'm going to show you an example of what I mean.
Let's look at a good decision -- buying a car.
This is a German German manufacturer of cars that allow you to <unk>
You have to take 60,000 decisions to build the car.
And these choices vary in the number of options that offers each one.
<unk> color of the car. I have 56 possibilities.
You have a box of <unk> four options.
So what I'm going to do is change the order in which the decisions come in.
So half of the clients are going to go from a lot of options, 56 colors, at a few moments -- four boxes.
The other half of the clients are going to go from a few options, four <unk> to 56 colors, a lot of options.
And what am I going to <unk>
What about you are.
If you look at the default button, it indicates that they're <unk> or <unk> we are <unk>
We found that the ones that go from a lot of choices to few days, you know, the default button over and over again.
<unk> <unk>
If you go from a few options to many, they continue there.
Same information, the same number of options.
The only thing I did was disrupt the order in which the information is presented.
If we start with the easy thing, you learn to <unk>
If you pick the box of change doesn't tell you nothing about the preferences of interior decoration.
We are excited about a product that we're building that are now more engaged in the process.
To sum up.
I've talked about four techniques to mitigate the problem of the overload of <unk> <unk> eliminating alternative alternatives -- we can do it <unk> <unk> we can run more categories at least <unk> <unk>
All these techniques that I've introduced you were designed to help manage the <unk> or better for you, to use them in their own business, or for people who will work.
It's that I think the key to getting the best of a choice is to be careful the <unk>
And the more careful how to be in our best choices we can practice art art.
Thank you very much.
In the '60s in East Germany -- <unk> -- if you had a typewriter <unk> to the government.
I had to record a sheet of text written with the machine.
And this for the government to track the origin of texts.
If they found a written on the wrong message, you could track the footprint to the origin of the idea.
In the West we don't think that someone could do this, how much this would make the freedom of expression.
We would never do that in our countries.
But today, in 2011, if you buy a laser color printer.
That's happening today.
And nobody seems to be a lot like this.
This is an example of the ways that our governments use technology against us, citizens.
And it's one of the three main causes of problems in the network.
If you look at what happens in the online world we can put together the attacks of their <unk>
There are three main groups.
Are you <unk>
Like Mr. <unk> <unk> from the city of <unk> in Ukraine.
Your mobile phone is very easy to understand.
These guys make money.
They use <unk> to make a lot of money, enormous amounts of it.
There are really many cases of <unk> online, <unk> money with their attacks.
This is <unk> <unk> of <unk> <unk>
This is Alfred <unk>
This is Stephen <unk>
This is <unk> <unk>
These are Matthew Anderson, <unk> <unk> etc., etc.
These guys do their fortunes online, but they do it by illegal means by illegal <unk> to steal money from our bills when we buy in <unk> or steal our keys to get information from our cards when we buy a <unk> computer.
The secret service of the U.S., two months ago, <unk> the <unk> <unk> of this guy, Sam <unk> and this account had <unk> million dollars when it was frozen.
Mr. <unk> is <unk> you don't know your <unk>
And I say that today is more likely than any of us are a victim of a <unk> than a real crime.
And it's very obvious that this is going to be worse.
In the future, most crimes will happen online.
The second group of <unk> in importance we see today is not driven by money.
There's another thing that moves, the protests, the protests, the protests are giving them laughter.
Groups like Anonymous have <unk> over the last 12 months, occupying a dramatic role in the online attacks.
Those are the three main <unk> the criminals who do for money, the <unk> like Anonymous who do to protest and the last group are the United States the United States the governments that <unk>
And then we see cases like <unk>
That's a good example of government against its own citizens.
<unk> is a <unk> authority of the Netherlands, or actually, it was.
It <unk> the last fall because of a <unk>
You get the security of the site and make it a <unk>
I was looking at the last week with the representatives of the Dutch government -- I asked one of the leaders if you were to <unk> <unk> death of people who are causing the attack to <unk>
And the answer of he was yes.
So how do people die of a attack of these?
<unk> is a <unk> authority.
<unk> <unk>
Why do we serve <unk>
Well, you need if you have a web site with <unk> services like <unk>
Except that <unk> a foreign authority.
And they were starting to shoot <unk>
And in the case of <unk> it happened exactly that.
And what happened in the Arab Spring and those things that have happened, for example, in <unk>
Well, in Egypt the protesters <unk> the headquarters of the Egyptian secret police headquarters in April 2011 and during the building, they found a lot of papers.
Among the papers was this folder called <unk>
And within that folder, there was notes of a company based on the headquarters in Germany in Germany that had sold the Egyptian government to intercept a large scale of the citizens of the citizens of the country.
They had sold this tool for 3,000 euros the government <unk>
The company headquarters is right here.
That is, Western governments provide tools to government governments to do this to their citizens.
But Western governments are also doing this to themselves.
For example, in Germany, just a couple of weeks ago, I found the <unk> <unk> a <unk> used by official government officers to investigate their own citizens.
If you're suspicious in a criminal case, it's pretty obvious that your phone is <unk>
But today it's more there.
It was <unk> the Internet connection.
<unk> even tools like <unk> <unk> to infect our computer with a <unk> to allow them to see all the communication, and listen to the online discussions to get our data.
When we think carefully about things like these things like the obvious answer should be a bad thing, but it doesn't really affect me because I'm an honest citizen.
Why did we care?
I have nothing to be <unk>
And that argument doesn't make any sense.
It's actually playing privacy.
<unk> is not <unk>
It's not a matter of privacy against safety.
It's about the freedom of control.
If we could trust our governments today in 2011, any right that we have today, will be forever.
<unk> at any future government, in a administration that we could have within 50 years?
These are the questions that you have to worry about in the next 50 years.
Here is where I live in Kenya, in the south of the National Park in Nairobi.
These are the cows of my dad at the background, and behind the cows, the National Park in Nairobi.
The National Park of Nairobi has no <unk> at most of the South, which means that wild animals like <unk> migrate outside the park.
And predators, like the lions, and this is what they do.
We <unk> our cattle.
This is one that killed at night, and as soon as we wake up in the morning, and we found it dead -- I felt very bad because it was the only <unk> we had.
My community, the <unk> we believe we came out of the sky with our animals and all the land to <unk> and that's why we value it so much.
So I grew up with the lions.
The dying are warriors who protect our community and livestock and also <unk> with the problem.
So they kill lions.
This is one of the six lions who killed in Nairobi.
I think this is so few in the National Park in Nairobi.
A child in my community, in the age of nine to nine years, is responsible for the livestock of his father and this was the same thing that happened to me.
So I had to find a way to fix this problem.
My first idea was to use fire, because I thought that lions was afraid to be afraid.
But I realized that actually this was not <unk> because even he helped lions see the pen away.
I don't get rid of it.
A second idea was to use a <unk>
He was trying to trick lions so they believed that I was near the <unk>
But lions are very clever.  They came the first day and they looked up, but the second day, they came back and they said, "Well, this thing is not moving, it's always here.  So he went up here.
So one night I was walking around the pen with a torch and that day, lions didn't come from.
And I found out that lions are afraid of light that moves.
So I had an idea.
And I got a switch on that to turn on and turn the lights off.
And this is a little lamp.
We got everything.
As you can see, the solar cell load the battery and the <unk> battery -- the electricity to the little box <unk> I call it a transformational.
And the box <unk> does it make the lights <unk>
As you can see, the <unk> get outside, because that's where lions.
And that's how they see lions when they come from night.
The lights are <unk> and <unk> to lions so you think I'm walking around the <unk> but I'm sleeping in my bed.
Thank you.
So I put them in my home two years ago, and since then, we never had a problem with lions.
And the neighborhood houses, you heard the idea.
One of them is from this grandmother.
She had killed a lot of animals -- the lions and asked me if I could put the lights.
I said yes.
You can see the <unk> these are the lights for lions.
Since then, I've installed them at seven homes in my community and they're serving very much.
And my idea is also used by all Kenya, to frightening to other predators like <unk> <unk> and it's also used for <unk> elephants in the farms.
And because of this invention, I was fortunate to get a grant in one of the top schools in Kenya, <unk> International School, and I'm very excited.
My new school is now helping us raise money and <unk>
And I even took my friends to my community and we installed the lights in the homes that they don't have, and I teach them how to <unk>
So a year ago, I was just a child in the meadows of the savanna <unk> the cows of my father, and he used to see flying airplanes and told me that someday would be within one.
And here I am.
I got the opportunity to come in an airplane for the first time to TED.
My great dream is to get to be a aviation engineer, and a pilot when I grow up.
I used to hate the lions, but now as my invention is saving the cows of my dad and the lions, we can be with lions without any conflict.
<unk> <unk> What in my tongue means thank you very much.
Chris Anderson: You don't picture how exciting it is to hear a story like you.
So you get a <unk> Richard <unk> Yes.
CA: You're working on other electrical <unk>
What's the next one on your list?
<unk> My next invention is -- I want to make an electrical <unk> CA: One near <unk>
<unk> I know you invented electric <unk> but I want to do my own.
CA: As I heard it once, right? And I have tried it before, but I stopped because I got a <unk>  CA: At the foot, Richard <unk> is a big thing.
We're going to be <unk> in every single step that I want my friend.
Thank you very much. <unk> Thank you very much.
When I was a little girl, I thought my country was the best on the planet.
And I grew up singing a song called "No <unk> <unk>
And I was very proud.
At school, we would spend all the time studying the story of Kim <unk> but we never learned a lot about the rest of the world, except the Americas, South Korea, Japan is enemies.
Although sometimes I wondered about the rest of the world, I thought it would happen all my life in North Korea, until everything changed a sudden <unk>
When I was seven years old, I saw my first public <unk>
But I thought that my life in North Korea was normal.
My family wasn't poor and I was never hungry.
But one day, in 1995, my mom brought home a letter from my sister
That said, "When we <unk> this, the five members of the family will never exist in this world, because we haven't eaten it in the two weeks before.
We're <unk> together on the floor, and our bodies are so weak that we're ready to die."
It was very <unk>
It was the first time I heard people were suffering in my country.
At the time when I was walking in front of the train station, I saw something terrible that I can't erase my memory.
One woman without life was dead in the streets, holding a child in his arms looking at the face of his mother without able to do anything.
No one <unk> because they were very concerned about how they were looking for their families.
A huge famine entered North Korea in the <unk>
In the end, over a million North Koreans died during famine and only few survived eating grass, insects and <unk>
They also became more and more frequent <unk> all around it, all around it was completely dark at night except for the lights in the sea in China, barely crossing the river from my home.
I always wondered why they had light and we don't.
This is a satellite picture of North Korea at night compared to the countries of the neighbors.
This is the <unk> River, which serves between North Korea and China.
As you can see, the river can be very <unk> in certain points, allowing North Koreans to cross <unk>
But many people die.
Sometimes, I saw bodies floating on the river.
I can't reveal the details of how I came out of North Korea, but I can only say that during the years of starvation I was sent to China to live with relatives <unk>
But I just thought I'd be separated from my family for the short time.
I could never have imagined that I would take <unk> to live together.
In China, it was hard to live as a young woman without my family.
I had no idea what life would be like a <unk>
But I learned that it's not just extremely difficult, but also dangerous, because refugee refugees in China were considered illegal immigrants.
So I was living with a constant fear that my identity was <unk> and it would be <unk> to a horrible fate of a turn in North Korea.
A day, my worst nightmare was made, when I was arrested for the Chinese police and <unk> in the police station.
Somebody had accused me for being <unk> then <unk> my skills in the Chinese language, and they asked me a lot of questions.
He was <unk>
I thought my heart was going to exploit.
If it didn't seem natural, it could be incarcerated and <unk>
I thought my life was going to end.
But I managed to control my emotions and said the questions.
At the end of the <unk> an officer said to another, this was a false <unk> She's not <unk>
And they let me go. It was a miracle.
Some Koreans in China are looking for asylum <unk>
But many of you can be arrested for the Chinese police and <unk>
These women had a lot of luck.
Although there was <unk> they were eventually released after an international pressure.
These North Koreans were not so lucky.
Every year, countless Koreans are captured in China and <unk> to North Korea, where they're <unk> <unk> or executed in public.
Though I was lucky to escape -- many other North Koreans have not been so lucky.
It's tragic that North Koreans have to hide their identities and fight so hard just to survive.
Even after learning a new language, and find work, all their world can be <unk> in a second.
That's why 10 years of hiding my identity, I've decided to be a chance to go to South Korea
And I started a new life again.
<unk> in South Korea was a much greater challenge than I expected.
English was very important in South Korea, I had to start learning my third language.
I also understood that there was a big gap between North and South Africa.
We are all <unk> but inside, we've come to be very different because of 67 years of <unk>
Even I went through a identity crisis.
I'm a <unk> or <unk>
Where am I? Who am I?
And suddenly there was no country that I could call with a <unk>
Although we went to life in South Korea was not easy, I did a plan. I started studying for the exam exam to college.
Just when I was starting to go back to my new life, I got an alarming call.
The North Korean authorities would send some money that sent my family to my family, and, as a blame, my family was going to be shifted to the force to a remote location in the <unk>
They had to flee immediately.
So I started planning how to help them escape.
North Koreans have to travel long distances on the way to freedom.
It is almost impossible to cross the border of North Korea and South Korea, and South Korea
So ironically, I took a flight to China, and I was pushing to the border with North Korea.
Because my family couldn't speak Chinese, I had to <unk> it somehow, for more than 3,000 miles across China, and then through Southeast Asia.
The journey in <unk> took a week, and we were almost caught several times.
Once, our bus was stopped and <unk> for a police officer.
He asked all of us, and he started asking them questions.
As my family couldn't understand Chinese, I thought my family was going to be arrested.
When the Chinese officer came up to my family, <unk> I stood up and told him that they were <unk> people who were <unk>
He looked at me and I looked at me.
We did all the way up to the border of <unk>
But I had to spend almost all my money to bribe the guards on <unk>
But even after the border, my family was arrested and incarcerated for crossing the border <unk>
After paying <unk> and bribes, my family was released in a month.
But at time, my family was arrested and incarcerated again in the capital of <unk>
This was one of the lowest points in my life.
I did everything to release my family, and we were so close to it, but my family was <unk> in prison to cut away from the embassy of South Korea.
I was going and came between the immigration office and the police station, desperately trying to release my family.
But I didn't have enough money to pay more bribes or <unk>
I lost hope.
At that time, or the voice of a man thought, "What is the problem?"
I was so shocked that a stranger would mind to ask.
With my poor English and a dictionary, I told him the situation, and the <unk> the man was the <unk> and gave me the rest of the money for my family and for another two North Koreans and take them out of prison.
And I read it with all my heart, and I said, "Why do I <unk>
"I'm not <unk> he said.
"I'm helping the village <unk>
I realized that was a symbolic moment in my life.
The kind unknown, the kind unknown, a new hope for me and for the village <unk> when we get it more <unk>
And I showed you that the goodness of strangers and support of the international community are really the rays of hope that the <unk> people need.
Over time, after our long journey, my family and I came together in South Korea, and I sat in South Korea.
But achieving their freedom is only half the battle.
Many North Koreans are separated from their families and when they go to a new country, they start with a little bit of money.
So we can benefit from the international community with education, practice of the English language, of work, and more.
We can also act as a bridge between people in North Korea and the rest of the world.
Because a lot of us keep in contact with the relatives still inside, and we send information and money that are helping to change North Korea from the inside.
I've been very <unk> I've got a lot of help and inspiration in my life, so I want to help Koreans an opportunity to thrive with international support.
And I'm sure you're going to see more and more North Koreans are going to come across the world, including at the TED stage.
Thank you.
I live in the South.
This is <unk> <unk> stores of <unk> food, <unk> terrain.
And so the city planners got together, and they thought, "We are going to change the South Center for it to represent something else, so they switched to Los Angeles in the South battle, as if this is really wrong with what is actually wrong in the city.
This is the South Los Angeles --  <unk> of <unk> fast food, <unk>
Just like <unk> millions of other Americans live in a <unk> food, the Los Angeles Center for the <unk> places to carry and eat in the car.
And the curious thing is that the places of food to lead you kill more people than the food in the car.
People are dying of <unk> diseases in the Los Angeles Center.
For example, the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times bigger than say, Beverly <unk> which is like 15 miles away.
I was pleased to see this happen.
And I wonder, how would you feel if you didn't have access to healthy food, and if every time you come home see the <unk> effects that the current food system has in your <unk>
I see chairs of <unk> <unk> and sold as <unk> cars.
I see <unk> <unk> centers like <unk>
And I consider this to stop.
I think the problem is the solution.
<unk> is the problem and the solution.
In addition to me tired I got tired of taking 45 minutes back and buy an apple that doesn't have any pesticides.
What I did, was planting a food forest in front of my house.
In a band of land that we call a <unk>
It's 45 me three meters of me.
The point is, it belongs to the city.
But you have to <unk>
I said, "Well, I can do the thing that comes in <unk> because it's my responsibility and I have to be <unk>
So this was how I decided to do it.
So my group and I, <unk> Green <unk> we put together and we started planting our food forest and <unk> trees -- you know, nine full vegetables do.
What we do, we're a kind of a bunch of a bunch of paid <unk> made by gardeners of all the <unk> and completely volunteer, and everything we do is free.
And the garden, was beautiful.
And then someone gets stuck.
The city <unk> me on top and <unk> I was given a <unk> saying that I had to remove my garden, the <unk> was made order of justice.
And I said, "Come on in it?
A court order for plant food on a piece of land that nobody was <unk>  And so I was like, "Well, you know?
Because this time I wasn't going to happen.
L.A. Times had the written story written by Steve <unk> and he talked to the <unk> and one of the <unk> <unk> who put a petition to <unk> with 900 <unk> we were a success.
We had the victory in our hands.
My <unk> even called to say that <unk> and <unk> what we were doing.
I mean, we go, why not?
L.A. is the city of the United States with <unk>
It has <unk> <unk>
That's 20 Central <unk>
That is enough space to plant <unk> million of <unk>
Why on earth does not look like this?
<unk> a plant to give a thousand thousand seeds.
When a dollar of <unk> will give you 75 dollars a result.
It's my <unk> when I tell the people, growing your own food.
<unk> your own food is how to print your own money.
You see, I have a legacy for the south.
I grew up there. It was my children there.
I became a part of this <unk> reality that was <unk> for me for others, and I'm going to manufacture my own reality.
You see, I'm an artist.
<unk> is my <unk> I grew up my <unk>
Like a <unk> artist who <unk> walls, I <unk> soils, <unk>
I use the garden, the land, like a piece of canvas, and the plants and the trees, are my <unk> of that canvas.
It is <unk> to see what earth can do, if you let it be their canvas.
You simply can't imagine how amazing it is a <unk> and how it affects people.
What happened?
I'm witness to how my garden became a training tool in a transformation tool.
To change the community, you have to change the composition of the soil.
We are the land.
It is <unk> to see how to affect the kids.
<unk> is the most <unk> act and provocative act that can do, especially in a <unk>
Also, you get <unk>
I remember one occasion, who came a mother and his daughter, <unk> was like the <unk> of the night and they were in my yard, and I went out and looked very <unk>
I, good, man, I felt bad that they were there, and I said, you know, you don't have to do this that way.
This is on the street for a reason.
I felt shame to see people who were so close to me and hungry, and this is just <unk> why I do this, people ask me, don't temes that people go to rob your <unk>
What I say, "For God no, I'm not afraid you're going to <unk>
It is in the street.
That's what it's about.
I want you to do it, but at his time, I want you to take his <unk>
There was another occasion that I put a garden in a homeless shelter at the center of Los Angeles.
They were these guys, who helped me download the truck.
It was great, they gave me his stories about how this was affected and how they used to plant her mom and her grandmother, and it was great to see how this changed, so it was just for a moment.
So Green <unk> has come to plant maybe 20 <unk>
We've had, like about 50 people who come from, work and <unk> all in a volunteer.
If the kids grow up, they eat <unk>
If they grow <unk> they eat <unk>  But if none of this is <unk> if you don't show them how food is affecting the mind and the body, they eat blind what they put them in front of them.
I see young people who want to work, but they have this thing in which you're <unk> I see color guys that are on this way for them, that it takes them nowhere.
With the <unk> I see a chance in which we can train these kids who were <unk> from their communities to have sustainable life.
And when we do this, who knows?
Maybe this is the next George Washington <unk>
But if we don't change the composition of the land, we never will.
Now this is one of my plans, this is something I want to do.
I want to plant a whole block of gardens, where people can share food in the same block.
I want to take containers and turn them into healthy.
I don't get paid.
I'm not talking about free, because free is not sustainable.
The curious thing about sustainability, is that you have to <unk>
What I'm talking about is to work with the people, pull the guys out of the streets, who know the joy, the pride and the honor of growing their own food, opening markets markets.
What I want to do here, we have to make it sexy.
I want everyone to become <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We need to change the script of what a <unk> is.
If you're not a <unk> you're not a <unk>
What do you have to do is take your <unk>
That is your weapon of choice.
In <unk> if you want to meet me, you know, if you want to see me, you don't call me if you want to sit in comfortable chairs and have meetings to talk about doing some <unk> to talk about making some shit.
If you want to see me, you come into the garden with your <unk> so we can plant something.
Peace Thank you.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk>  You probably all agree with me where this is a very nice road here.
It's made out of tarmac, and the asphalt is a good material to drive, but not always, especially not in days like today, where it rains a lot.
You can have a lot of water in asphalt that we <unk>
And especially if you go into your bicycle and these cars go, that's not very nice.
Also, the asphalt can make a lot of noise.
It's a noisy material and if we build roads, like in the Netherlands, very close to the cities, we want a quiet road to see.
The solution for that is to do <unk> roads.
The asphalt is a material that we use now in most of the roads in the Netherlands, and the water can go through it, so that all the rainwater flows into the sides and they will have a road because it's easy to drive, and they don't get water to it.
The noise also disappear in these <unk>
Because it's very open to the whole noise <unk> so it's a very quiet path.
It has <unk> of course, and the disadvantage of this road is that you can <unk>
What is <unk> Look at that road the stones in the surface are <unk>
It was a stone, then several more and more and more and more, etc., and then -- well, I'm not going to do that.  But you can harm your <unk> and you're not happy with that.
And finally, this can also get more and more damage.
Sometimes you can create <unk> with that.
<unk> It's ready.
<unk> of course, can be turned into a problem, but we have a solution.
Here you can actually see what damage is in this material.
It's a asphalt asphalt as I said, so it only has a little amount of <unk> between stones.
Because of the <unk> the <unk> light to the <unk> this <unk> this <unk> the glue between the <unk> is <unk> and if they were <unk> they will be <unk> and they separate from the <unk>
So if you drive on the road, you get the <unk> like we saw it here.
To solve this problem, we think about <unk> materials.
If we can make this material <unk> then we probably have a solution.
So what we can do is use wool <unk> of that to clean <unk> and we can cut the steel wool in very small pieces, and we can mix these little bits with the <unk>
So we have asphalt with little pieces of steel wool in it.
Then you need a machine, like the one you see here, that you use for <unk> a <unk> machine.
<unk> can warmth, especially the steel, is very good at that.
So what you have to do is heat the steel, melt the <unk> the <unk> flow by these <unk> and the rocks will go back to the surface.
So today I used a microwave oven, because I can't bring the big machine from <unk> here to the stage.
The microwave oven. It's a similar system.
I put the show that I'm now going to take you to see what happened.
This is the sample that comes out now.
I said we have this kind of industrial machine in the lab to heat the shows.
We tried a lot of samples out there, and then the government, really saw our results, and they thought, "Well, that's very interesting. We need to <unk>
So we gave us a piece of road, 400 meters of the <unk> highway, where we had to make a test lane to prove this material.
So that was what we did in there, and you see where we were doing the road, and then of course, this road will last several years without any damage. That's what we know about practice.
We take a lot of samples from this road and try them in the lab.
We did age the samples, we put a lot of burden on them, the truth then with our <unk> machine and the <unk> and we went back to it.
We can repeat this many times.
Well, to conclude, I can tell you that we've made a material using steel fibers, bringing these fibers, using the energy of <unk> to actually increase the life of the surface of the road, even you can double the life of the surface and really save a lot of money with very simple tricks in the surface.
And now, of course, you have curiosity if this also worked.
We still have the sample here. It's pretty hot.
It actually has to cool first before you can show them what the repair is.
But I'm going to do a try.
Let's see. Yes, it works.
Thank you.
When I was 11 years old, I remember having woken up a morning with the sound of the <unk> in my home.
My father was listening BBC -- News on his little gray radius.
I had a big smile on his face that was unusual at those days, because the news often would be <unk>
"The Taliban <unk> screamed at my father.
I didn't know what to do, but I could see my father was very, very happy.
"Now you can go to a <unk> school, he said.
One morning I will never forget.
A real school.
You see, I was six years old when the Taliban stopped Afghanistan, and they made illegal girls to go to school.
For the next five years, I was <unk> as a child to <unk> my older sister who could no longer be outside, to go to a secret school."
It was the only way that the two could be <unk>
Every day, we made a different route so that nobody could suspect where we were headed.
We had to hide the books in the market bags so it looks like we were <unk>
The school was in a house, more than 100 percent of us <unk> in a small room.
It was nice in the winter, but extremely <unk> in summer.
We all knew that <unk> our lives, the teacher, the students and our parents.
And occasionally, the school was suddenly closed for a week, because the Taliban <unk>
We always wondered what they knew about us.
They were <unk>
Did you know where it is.
We were <unk> but yet, the school was where we wanted to be.
I was very lucky to grow in a family where education was <unk> and the daughters a <unk>
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time.
A total <unk> of a remote province of Afghanistan -- when his daughter, my mother was to school, and so his father was <unk>
But my mother's mother became a teacher.
This is it.
It took two years ago, just to convert our home house to girls and women from our neighborhood.
And my father, this is the first of his family to get education.
There was no doubt that their children had to receive education, even their daughters, despite the <unk> despite the risks.
For him, there was a higher risk in not to educate their children.
For the years of the <unk> I remember there were moments when I was very frustrated about our life and I was always scared and I didn't see a future.
I wanted to give up, but my father said, <unk> daughter -- you can lose everything you have in life.
You can steal your money, you can be able to leave your house during a war.
But there's one thing that is always going to be with you, what's here and if we have to sell our blood to pay your education, we will.
So, you still want not to <unk>
I'm <unk> today.
I grew up in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war.
Less than six percent of my age women have more than the time, and if my family had not been so committed to my education, I would be one of them.
Instead, I find myself a proud to graduate from <unk> College.
When I went back to Afghanistan, my grandfather, the one who was <unk> from his home for the courage to educate his daughters, was one of the first to <unk>
He didn't just get rid of my college degree, but also I was the first woman, and I'm the first woman, I have driving it through the streets in Kabul.
My family believe in me.
I sleep in big sleep, but my family has even bigger dreams for <unk>
That's why I am the global ambassador, of <unk> a global campaign to educate women.
That's why I cofounded <unk> the first and maybe the only private school for girls in Afghanistan, a country in which is still risky for girls to go to school.
The exciting thing is that I see the students in my school with the strong desire to harness the opportunity.
And I see his parents and their families that, like the mine, <unk> for them, despite the fact and even in front of an opposition opposition.
As <unk> is not his name, and I can't show you his face, but Ahmed is the father of one of my students.
Less than a month, he and his daughter were going to go from the <unk> to his village, and literally escaped to be killed by a bomb on the way, for minutes.
When you get to his house, they are the phone, a voice told him that if I was still sending his daughter to school, they would come to try.
<unk> already, if <unk> said, "but not harm the future of my daughter for his old and <unk> ideas."
What I've realized about Afghanistan, and it's something that is often forgotten in the West, it's that behind most of the people who <unk> there is a father who recognized the value of his daughter and he sees that success of her own success.
It doesn't mean that our mothers have not been key to our success.
In fact, they're the first compelling <unk> of the brilliant future of their daughters, but in the context of a society like Afghanistan, we need the support of men.
Under the <unk> the girls who went to school are told in <unk> remember, it was illegal.
But today, more than three million girls are going to school in Afghanistan.
Afghanistan looks so different from here in the U.S.
I find that Americans see the fragility of the changes.
You know, these changes didn't last long, after the retirement of the U.S.
But when I go back to Afghanistan, when I look at the students in my school and their parents that I knew for them, that the <unk> see a <unk> future.
For me, Afghanistan is a country of hope and possibilities and <unk> and every day girls from <unk> I would <unk>
Like me, they dream big.
Thank you.
Never have never forgotten the words of my grandmother who died in the <unk> <unk> resists <unk> <unk> against him.
But you never come back a revolutionary <unk>
It's almost two years since the <unk> revolution inspired by the <unk> of mass <unk> both of the <unk> revolution as well as <unk>
A forces with many other <unk> citizens inside and out of the country to call one day of anger and initiate a revolution against the <unk> regime of <unk>
And the <unk> was a great revolution.
Women and young men <unk> were in the <unk> <unk> the decline of the regime, <unk> of freedom, dignity and social justice.
Have you shown a assume in the Creative dictatorship dictatorship of <unk>
You've shown a great sense of solidarity from the <unk> East, to the west, down to the south.
Finally, after a period of six months of brutal war, and a loss of about 50 thousand dead, we managed to release our country and remove the <unk>
However, <unk> quit a <unk> a legacy of <unk> corruption and <unk>
For four decades, the regime <unk> <unk> destroyed the infrastructure and culture and moral structure of society.
<unk> of the devastation and the challenges, I've got dear to many other women, rebuild civil society <unk> <unk> a free transition and just toward democracy and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national reconciliation and national inequality.
There were about 200 organizations in <unk> <unk> and immediately after the fall of <unk> about 300 in <unk>
After a <unk> period of exile, I went back to Libya and with a unique enthusiasm I started organizing workshops about developing <unk> and leadership skills.
With an incredible group of women we founded the <unk> Women of Women -- <unk> <unk> of <unk> leaders, very <unk> to advocate for the <unk> of the woman and for our right participation right in the building of democracy and peace.
I found myself with a very difficult environment in the <unk> period, an environment that was getting more and more <unk> than it was focused on selfish and women's <unk>
Over time, our initiative was approved and successful.
Women won a <unk> of the National Congress in the first election in 52 years.
However, little enough, the exhilaration of elections and the revolution as a whole, were <unk> every day we found news from violence.
One day we woke up with the news of <unk> ancient mosques and <unk>
Another day <unk> with the news of the murder of the American ambassador, and the attack to <unk>
Another day we woke up with the news of the murder of the army.
And every day, every day, every day we woke up with the government of <unk> and the <unk> of the human rights rights of the prisoners and their lack of respect of law.
Our society, made up a <unk> mentality, and it has been away from the ideals and principles of freedom, social justice, which we had at the beginning.
<unk> <unk> and revenge became the icons of the consequences of the revolution.
I'm not here today at all right now to deal with our history of success in <unk> <unk> and the election.
But I'm here today to tell you that we, as a nation, we choose to make the wrong decision.
We don't prioritize okay.
Because elections didn't brought into peace, stability and security to Libya.
The <unk> list and the <unk> between candidates and <unk> brought peace and reconciliation peace and <unk>
No, they didn't.
What happened then?
Why is our society still <unk> and dominated by selfish policies of domination and <unk> both for men as per women?
Maybe what was missing was not only women, but the women's values of compassion, mercy and <unk>
Our society needs the national dialogue and the creation of consensus more than we needed the election, which is just <unk> the polarization and <unk>
Our nation needs the <unk> representation of the most of the most of the most of the <unk> representation of it.
We need to stop acting as <unk> and call days of anger.
We need to start to act like compassion and for mercy.
We need to develop a female speech, not only <unk> but also put the mercy instead of <unk> the collaboration instead of the competition, the <unk> instead of <unk>
These are the ideals that a Libya, is going to be desperately in order to achieve peace.
Because peace has a <unk> which is about the <unk> and <unk> between female perspectives and <unk>
That's the real <unk>
We need to establish that kind of existential way before it was <unk>
According to the Koran <unk> <unk> <unk> "is the word of God <unk> <unk> <unk>
At the time, the word <unk> that is known in all the <unk> traditions -- it has the same root in Arabic that the word <unk> <unk> the <unk> and <unk> that spans the whole of the humanity that men and women, who all tribes and all the peoples have <unk>
And so just like the uterus covers the <unk> which grows inside, the divine extracellular matrix of compassion -- all existence.
So it comes to us, "My <unk> <unk> all the things."
So he says, "My <unk> <unk> on my <unk>
You know, they will all be given the grace of mercy.
Thank you.
I'm here today to talk to you today about a hopeful question, which has an equally <unk> response.
This is about the secrets of domestic violence, and the question I'm going to deal with is the one that everybody else is doing a while. Why she is left?
Why was somebody who was going to stay with a man who was <unk>
I'm not a psychiatrist, or a social worker, no expert in domestic violence.
I'm just a woman with a story to tell.
I was 22 years old. I was just at Harvard University.
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and publisher in the journal <unk>
I had my first apartment, my first green <unk> American <unk> and I had a very big secret.
My secret was that many, many times, the man, who I believed my alma mater, <unk> my head with a <unk> <unk> <unk>
The man, when I loved anyone in this world, put a gun in my head and <unk> with <unk> more times than I can remember.
I'm here to tell you the story of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> where they fall every year millions of women, and even some men.
It could be his story.
I don't look like a typical survivor of domestic violence.
I'm a <unk> in English University, and I have an MBA in <unk> of Business <unk>
I've spent the most of my career working for <unk> list, <unk> among them Johnson & Johnson, Leo <unk> and The Washington <unk>
I've been married almost 20 years married to my second husband and we have three children.
My dog is a black <unk> and <unk> a <unk> <unk> <unk>
So my first message to you is that domestic violence can happen to anyone, all races, all races, all the income and education.
It's everywhere.
And my second message is that everybody thinks that domestic violence happens to women, which is a women's problem.
Not exactly.
Over 85 percent of the <unk> are men, and domestic abuse only happens in relationships and <unk> and <unk> in the families, in the families, the last place where we want or expect to find <unk> why domestic abuse is so <unk>
I would have told you that it would be the last person in the world that was going to stand with a man who does it with a man who does it, and actually I was a very typical victim because of my age.
I was 22 years old, and in the United States women in between 16 and 24 years old, they have three times more likely to be victims of domestic violence than the other ages, and over 500 women and girls from that age are killed every year by couples, <unk> and young men in the United States.
I was also a typical victim because I didn't know anything about domestic violence, its warning signals or your pattern.
I met <unk> in a cold cold and November night.
I was sitting next to my side in New York City, and he started to play it with me.
He said two things.
The first one was that he had just been <unk> from a <unk> <unk> <unk> and working on a very important bank of Wall Street.
But what struck me most in that first encounter was that it was ready and fun, and that seemed like a field.
And I had some big <unk> like blocks, and an <unk> wheat, and it seemed so sweet.
One of the most intelligent things that made it <unk> was to create the illusion that I was the dominant component of a mate.
He did it all at the beginning of a <unk>
And we started out and loved all of me -- that was ready to be ready, which I went to Harvard, I would put a passion to help teenagers, and my work.
I wanted to know all about my family, my childhood, my dreams and illusions.
He believed in me, as a writer, and as a woman, like no one had ever done it.
And it was why the bachelor's of that <unk> school and the work on Wall Street and his brilliant future had so much important to him.
I didn't know that the first phase in any relationship of domestic violence is <unk> and <unk> the victim.
And I didn't know that the second step is <unk>
Now, the last thing I wanted to do was go from New York and leave the work of my dreams, but I thought I had to make a sacrifices for your partner, so I was able to quit my work and <unk> and I went together in Manhattan.
I had no idea that I was falling into a <unk> <unk> who was entering the head on a physical, financial trap.
The next step in the pattern of domestic violence is to introduce the threat of violence to see how it reacts to it.
And here is where those <unk> come in.
As soon as we moved to New England and you know, that site where it was supposed to be so safe to buy three <unk>
One was the <unk> of the car.
Another one he kept the pillow underneath the pillow and the third always in his pocket.
And he said that I needed those guns to cause the trauma that lived small.
I needed them to feel safe.
But those guns actually were a message for me, and even though I never had lifted my hand, my life was already at <unk> every minute of every day.
The first physical attack of <unk> was five days before our wedding.
They were seven in the morning and I still had the <unk>
Five days later, when the 10 bruises of my neck had <unk> I put my <unk> suit of my mother and married him.
Even though I had happened, I was sure that we were living happy forever, because I loved it, and he also wanted me so much.
And I was very, very <unk>
It just felt very <unk> for the wedding and the fact that they form a family with me.
It had been an isolated accident, and I would never be hurt.
I spent twice the moon of honey.
The first time I was driving into a secret beach and <unk> and he gave me so hard in the head that I <unk> several times against the <unk> of the car.
And then, a couple of days later, driving back from the moon of honey was taken out by the traffic and threw me a Big Mac to the face.
<unk> went on to <unk> one or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage.
I was fascinated by when I thought it was the only one in this situation.
One of three American women is a victim of domestic violence or at some point in their life, and the Center for Disease Control informs that every year 15 million children are <unk> 15 million.
So, actually, I had very good company.
Going back to my question: Why would you care?
The answer is simple.
I didn't know he was abusing me.
On the contrary, I was a very strong woman, in love with a profoundly <unk> man, and it was the only person in the world that could help us tackle their <unk>
The other question that everybody does is, why do you just not <unk>
Why didn't I tell me, I could have been at any time.
So for me this is the saddest and painful question that people do, because we know something that normally you <unk> is incredibly dangerous to abandon a <unk>
Because the last phase in the pattern of domestic violence is <unk>
More than 70 percent of domestic violence occur after the victim of domestic violence happens after the victim of <unk> because then the <unk> has nothing to lose.
Other implications include permanent <unk> even after the <unk> has gone back to marry, and <unk> of financial resources and manipulation of the family judicial system to support the victim and their children, who usually are forced by judges going to spend time -- not <unk> with the man who went to his mother.
And we still keep asking why it's simply not going?
I was able to go, because of a last <unk> <unk> beat my denial.
I realized that the man I loved so much, would have killed me if he had allowed.
So I broke silence.
I told the entire world to the police, the police, my neighbors, my friends, my friends and familiar with full unknown, and I'm here today because all of you helped me.
We have the trend for the victims of the victims of the victims of <unk> women -- <unk> goods.
The question, "Why do you <unk>
Some people is a way to say <unk> is -- it's by <unk> as if the <unk> victims of the men who want to <unk>
But since I published <unk> I have heard hundreds of stories of men and women who also claim that they learned a hopeful lesson of what happened to them, and they would bring their lives and happy and happy and <unk> wives completely free of violence, like mine.
Because it turns out I'm actually a victim and a survivor of domestic violence very typical of domestic violence.
I went back to marry a <unk> <unk> and kind of kind of <unk>
I have that <unk> black <unk> and also that <unk>
What I'm not going to go back to have more, I would never, ever be a gun with my head in hands of someone who says I will.
At this moment, the same thing is thinking, <unk> -- that's <unk> or <unk> what stupid <unk> but all this time I've actually been talking about you.
I assure you that there are a few people who are listening to me right now, who are being <unk> or they were <unk> or they are <unk> themselves.
The <unk> could be affecting his daughter, <unk> to her best friend right now.
I was able to put my crazy crazy love to be silent.
And I keep doing this today.
It's my way to help other victims, and it's my last request for you.
Talk about what you've heard here.
abuse are only in silence.
They have the power to end domestic violence simply shedding light on it.
The victims we need all over the world.
We need each of you to understand the secrets of domestic violence.
They had the <unk> of the light talking about it with their children, their friends, their friends and family.
<unk> their vision of survivors as fantastic people and <unk> that have a <unk> future.
You know, the <unk> signs of violence in order to intervene consciously, to slow down its climb and show the victims of a safe <unk>
And together we can convert our bed, our tables and our families in the oasis and <unk> that they should be.
Thank you.
Hello. I call this <unk> <unk> and for a while, I am model.
To be precise, for 10 years ago.
And I feel that at this moment there is an awkward tension in the room because I should have no dress like this.  Luckily, I've brought back clothes to <unk>
This is the first change of clothes on a <unk> scenario so you have a lot of <unk> I think.
If some of the women are <unk> when they <unk> they don't have to get them now, but to figure out later on Twitter.
I also want to point out that I have the privilege of being able to change what I think about me in just 10 seconds.
Not everybody has that opportunity.
These heels. are very <unk> less bad than I don't have to use.
The worst part is to go through the head, because it's when you're going to make fun of me, so you don't do anything while I cover your head.
All right.
Why have I done this?
It's been embarrassing.
Well, I hope not as much as this picture.
<unk> is powerful, but also <unk>
I have changed what they thought about me in six seconds.
And in this picture, he had never had a boyfriend, in real life.
And I was totally uncomfortable and the photographer told me that he <unk> the back and he would get the hair back.
Of course, with surgery, or a <unk> poetry like the one I made two days ago for work, there is very little that we can do it to transform our looks, which, even though shallow and <unk> has a huge impact on our lives.
So today, to me, be brave means to be honest.
I'm on this stage because I'm a model now.
Because I'm a nice woman and white, and in my labor sector, that's being a sexy girl.
I'm going to answer the questions that people always do, but <unk>
The first question is, how do you get to be model?
And I always say, <unk> <unk> but that doesn't mean anything.
The real reason that I did model is because I won the genetic lottery, and I'm the <unk> of an <unk> and maybe you're asking you what this <unk> is.
Well, in the last centuries we have not only defined beauty as health, youth and symmetry and which we're biologically biologically programmed to <unk> we also have been associated with a high and <unk> shape, and to a white skin.
And that is my <unk> institutions that I've known to leverage for money.
And I know there are people in the audience who now show up, and maybe there are some <unk> of the fashion that <unk> <unk> There are <unk> <unk> Joan <unk> <unk> <unk>
First of all, <unk> to know as much of models.
But unfortunately I have to report that in 2007, a Ph.D. student at the University of New York -- he told all and every models in the <unk> and the <unk> models -- only <unk> -- less than four percent, they were not white <unk>
The next question that people always ask me is: Does it be a model when it's <unk>
And my first answer is: I don't know, I don't care about that.
But after that, what I would really tell each of these girls is: Why? Can you be what you want.
You can be the president of the United States, or the <unk> of the next Internet, or a <unk> ninja and poet, which would be awesome, because you are the first.
If after this spectacular list, still <unk> No, no, <unk> I want to be a model, then I say, "I know my <unk>
Because I am not in charge of anything, and you could be the head of <unk> <unk> <unk> or the next <unk> <unk> or the next Steven <unk>
And to say that you want to be a model that's like saying that you want to win the lottery when you be older.
It's outside your control, it's shocking, and it's not a work that you can choose.
I'm going to show you all I learned about 10 years as a model, because unlike <unk> surgery, it can be summarized right now.
I don't know what happened there.
Unfortunately, once you get your studies, and you have a little bit of jobs to your back, no matter what you want to do, you know, you want to be the president of the United States, but you have a Model <unk> Model <unk> for 10 years, people would be <unk>
The next question that people always do is if all the pictures were <unk>
And yes, virtually all the photos, but that's just a little bit of what happens.
So this was the first picture that I was <unk> and also the first time I used a <unk> and I didn't even have my period.
I know that we're getting into the personal field, but it was a little girl.
So it was used by my grandmother a few months before.
These two pictures are the same day.
My friend came with me.
So here I am at a <unk> party.
So here I am with my football team and magazine birthday.
And this is me today.
And I hope you realize I'm not me in those photos.
They are creations of a professional group, <unk> <unk> photographers and <unk> and all their <unk> and <unk> and <unk> and they can create this. That's not me.
Well, the next question that people always ask me is to do things for free?
I have too many inches about 20 inches and I will never use, except the <unk> but the privilege I get in the real life, and that we don't like to talk about.
I grew up in Cambridge, and once I went to a store and I forgot to get money, and they gave me for free.
When I was a teenager, I was traveling with my friend who was a <unk> <unk> was released a red light and, of course, <unk> and <unk> a sorry, agent for power to keep <unk>
<unk> of these privilege for me, I don't know what I am. And there are people who are paying a price for what they are.
I live in New York City, and last year, of the teenagers who are <unk> and 86 percent were black and <unk> and most of them were young men.
And there are only <unk> young black and Latino men in New York City, so for them, it's not a question of <unk>
You know, how many times do I <unk>
When I research for this talk, I learned that to 53 percent of the girls in 13 years in the United States don't like their body, and that figure rises to 78 percent of the 17.
So the last question that people ask me is, how is life in a model?
And I think the answer that you expect is: If you're a little bit <unk> and you have the most bright hair, you'll feel very happy and beautiful.
And behind the cameras, we give an answer that maybe we can do it.
<unk> It's really wonderful to go, and also incredible power to work with ingenious and ingenious people.
And that's true, but it's just a part of what happens, because what we never say in front of the cameras, what I have never said in front of them, is: I'm <unk>
And I'm because I have to worry about my way every day.
And if you ever ask, with some more thin legs and the most bright hair, it will be happier?
They only have to meet with a group of models, because they have the most respected legs the most bright and <unk> <unk> but probably it's the most insecure women on the planet.
But mostly it was hard to look at a situation of race and gender of gender when I am one of the greatest <unk>
If there's something to keep out of this talk, I hope you all feel more comfortable when you recognize the power of the image in the perception of success and the failure.
Thank you.
Photography has been my passion since I was most enough to attach a camera, but I want to share with you my 15 pictures more <unk> and I didn't go to the <unk>
There was no <unk> no opportunity to repeat the photos, not even a good care of the lighting in the lighting.
In fact, most of them are taken at random.
My story starts when, <unk> in New York City to give a <unk> my wife pulled me this photo holding my daughter on the day of his first birthday. That's the corner of <unk> and 5.
I happened to go back to New York City just a year later, so we decided to take the same picture.
Well, you can imagine what comes right now.
When I was approaching the third birthday of my daughter, my wife told me, why don't you take <unk> to New York on a <unk> journey, and you continue to <unk>
So here is when we started asking tourists that they were going to make us <unk>
It's amazing that the gesture of giving the camera to a complete stranger is so universal.
No one has been denied and, fortunately, never no one has <unk>
So we weren't aware of how much life would change this journey.
It became a sacred thing to us.
This photo is a few weeks after the <unk> and I had to explain to my daughter what had happened that day in the way that a five-year-old could be understood.
These pictures are much more than performances of a concrete moment or a specific journey.
They're also a way to stop time on a week of October and to think about our time and evolution over the years, and not only the physical level, but in all the senses.
Because, even though we always put the same picture, our perspective changes, my daughter reaches new <unk> and I can see the life through your eyes and how you perceive and interact with everything.
That particular time that we spent together is something we hope with illusion all year.
So recently, on one of the travel, we were going to go out when all of a sudden, stopped in the dry and signal a red <unk> of the text store that <unk> small from the previous <unk>
And he described to me what it was for the five years of standing at the same place.
<unk> that remembered its heart <unk> with force to see that place for the first time nine years ago.
And now what he looks at New York City is universities, because it's determined to study in New York.
And suddenly I understood that one of the most important things we create is the memories.
So I want to share the idea of actively engaging in the conscious creation of memories.
I don't know about you, but apart from these 15 pictures, I don't go out in many of the family pictures.
I'm always the one who takes the photo.
So today, I want to encourage you all to appear in the picture, and you don't want to get up to someone and asked, do you get a <unk>
Thank you.
I'd like to tell you about a very special group of animals.
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world.
<unk> are in the <unk> group of <unk>
First of all, why do they have so bad <unk>
It has also been associated with Disney laughs <unk> as dumb dumb characters.
More recently, if you've been following the press -- laughter, applause and applause and <unk> these are the attributes that associated with Parliament -- but I don't accept it.
I don't accept it. You know why?
Because the members of Parliament don't clean the environment.  <unk> don't help prevent the spread of disease.
<unk> are <unk>   You're far from <unk>  And my favorite, the <unk> have better presence.
There are the <unk> of the New World who are mostly in <unk> like the <unk> and the <unk> and the World Bank, where we have 16 species of these, 11 times a high risk of extinction.
So why are we <unk> are important, and first of all, they provide vital ecological services.
It's our <unk>
They took those animals to the bone.
They help kill all the bacteria that were helping to absorb the anthrax that of not being used by them and caused large losses to livestock and diseases in other animals.
Recent surveys have shown that in areas where there are no <unk> the carcasses take three to four times more time in <unk> and this has huge ramifications of the spread of disease.
<unk> also have huge historical importance.
They've been associated with ancient <unk> culture.
<unk> was the symbol of <unk> and maternity and, along with the <unk> <unk> the unit between the Alto, and lower Egypt.
The <unk> <unk> <unk> was the god <unk> and risked his life to save the Tasmanian goddess of the Tasmanian devil?
In the <unk> culture, they do very important -- in places like <unk> -- in places like <unk> there is no place to bury the dead, or wood to <unk> so that these <unk> provide a natural disposal system.
What's the problem with <unk>
We have eight species of <unk> in Kenya, that six are at the end of extinction.
The reason is that they're being <unk> and the reason you're being <unk> is because there's conflict between humans and <unk> <unk> communities use this venom against predators, and as a consequence, the <unk> are victims of this.
In the south of Asia, in countries like India and Pakistan, four species of <unk> are on the critical list of extinction, which means that in less than 10 or 15 years is <unk> and the reason is because they land consumption of livestock that has been treated with a drug <unk> like <unk>
This drug has been banned to use vet in India and have taken a stance.
Because there is no <unk> there have been a spread in the number of <unk> dogs in <unk> <unk> and when you have <unk> dogs has a huge time bomb, and the number of cases of anger has increased in India.
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind farms in Africa, <unk> <unk> are going to be up from Lake <unk>
I'm not against wind energy, but we have to work with governments, because the wind turbines do this at the birds, they cut them in half.
They're <unk>
In Africa, there is a horrible trade trade that was dead to serve <unk> and the <unk> market.
So what are you doing? Okay, so we're researching these birds. We are <unk>
We're trying to figure out their basic ecology and see where they go.
We can see that they travel by different countries, so to focus on a locally affordable problem is not going to be <unk>
We need to work with governments at the regional level.
We're working with the local communities.
We're talking to them about appreciating the <unk> about the need to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that we <unk>
How can they help? It can make noise.
When you go out of this room, you're going to tell you about <unk> but talk to their families, with their children, with their neighbors on the <unk>
They are very <unk> Charles Darwin said that he changed from opinion because he saw it with no effort, no energy spending in the heavens.
Kenya, this world, will be much poorest without these wonderful species.
Thank you very much.
Each thing I run and everything I do -- my life has been <unk> for seven years of work for my youth in Africa.
From <unk> to 1977. <unk> young people, but I am not.  I worked in Zambia, Kenya, Costa <unk> <unk> and Somalia.
I worked for an NGO and every project that we set up in sub-Saharan Africa.
And I was <unk>
<unk> to the <unk> that Italians were good people, and we were doing a good job in Africa.
Instead of that, everything we played the <unk>
Our first project, which inspired my first book, <unk> from the <unk> was a project where some Italians decided to teach people about Zambia to grow food.
So we came up with <unk> <unk> in the south of Zambia to this absolutely magnificent valley that descends into the <unk> River, and we teach the local growing tomatoes and <unk> and ...
Of course, people were not at all interested in doing that, so they would tell them to come to work, and sometimes they were not <unk>  We were even aware that the locally, in so <unk> valley, they didn't have had agriculture.
And yet, instead of asking you how it was possible that we did nothing, we simply said, "Thank God that we are here."  So let's spend time to save the people from Zambia from the <unk>
And of course, all in Africa became <unk>
We got these gorgeous <unk> In Italy, a <unk> <unk> to this size.
And we couldn't believe it, we were telling the <unk> "Look at the <unk>
When tomatoes were <unk> <unk> and red <unk> on the morning, about 200 <unk> appeared from the river and ate it.  And we said to <unk> "Oh my God, the <unk>
And the <unk> they said, "Yeah, that's why we don't have agriculture here."  "Why don't you hear it, "You're never <unk>
I thought we only Italians know, Italians had mistakes in Africa, but then, I saw what the Americans, what the <unk> was doing what the French did, and after seeing what they were doing, I felt pretty proud of our project in Zambia.
Because, as you see, at least we feed the <unk>
You can see the <unk>  <unk> seeing the waste that we gave them to the <unk> people in Africa.
She wants to read a book, read <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
The book was printed in 2009.
We, Western donors have given the African continent two million dollars in the last 50 years.
I'm not going to tell you about the harm that the money has <unk>
Just read your book.
<unk> from a African woman, the harm that we've done.
The Westerners are <unk> missionaries <unk> and we treat people just from two things: or <unk> or <unk>
The two words come from the Latin <unk> <unk> which means <unk>
Yet, they mean two different things.
<unk> I try any of a different culture as if they were my kids, "I want you a lot of a lot of different as well.
<unk> I'm dealing with all of a culture as different as my <unk>
So whites in Africa are called <unk> <unk>
That book gave me a slap in the face of the face. Little <unk> written by <unk> who said by all economic development, if people don't want to be <unk> <unk> alone.
This should be the first beginning of help.
The first principle of aid is <unk>
This morning, the guy who opened this conference put a cane on the ground and said, we can -- you can imagine a city that's not <unk>
I decided that 27 years to just respond to people, and I invented a system called <unk> <unk> where you never start anything, you have ever been to anyone, but it becomes a <unk> of the local passion, the <unk> of the local people who have the dream of becoming a better person.
So what do you do? You <unk>
It never comes to a community with an idea, and you feel with the people of the <unk>
We don't work from offices.
We met in a bar.
We have zero infrastructure.
And what do we do? We become friends, and we found what the person wants to do.
The most important thing is passion.
You can give an idea to somebody.
If that person doesn't want to do that, what is going to do you?
The passion that she has for its own growth is the most important.
The passion that the man has for its own personal growth is the most important.
And then we help you find the knowledge because nobody in the world can be successful.
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge, but knowledge is available.
So years and years ago, I had this idea: Why not we, for once instead of getting to a community to tell people what to do, why not for once, for once, but not in community meetings.
I'll tell you a secret.
There's a problem with community meetings.
The entrepreneurs never <unk> and they will never tell you, in a public meeting, what they want to do with their own money, what opportunity have they identified.
So planning has this blind point.
The smartest person in their community, you don't even know it, because they don't end their public meetings.
What do we do? We work one to you, and we work face to face, you have to create social infrastructure, which doesn't exist.
You must create a new job.
The profession is the family doctor of the company, the family doctor of the business -- that sets up with you in your house, at the table of your kitchen table in the coffee, and that helps you find the resources to transform your passion in a way of a living.
I started this as a test in <unk> city of Western Australia.
I was doing a Ph.D. at that time, trying to get away from this <unk> <unk> where we got to tell you what to do.
In a year, I had 27 projects going, and the government came to me to see to ask, "How can you do that?
How can you do it?" And I said, "I did something very, very hard.
I was <unk>   So --  So the government says, <unk> <unk>  So we've done it in 300 communities in the world.
We have helped to start 40,000 businesses.
There's a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of loneliness.
Peter <unk> one of the most great business advisers in history, passed away to '96, a few years ago.
Peter <unk> was a professor of philosophy before involved in business, and this is what Peter <unk> <unk> is actually incompatible with a society and a company of company <unk>
<unk> is the kiss of the death of the <unk>
So now <unk> rebuilding <unk> without knowing what people most <unk> in <unk> want to do with their own money and their own energy.
You have to learn to get these people to come and talk to you with you.
You have to offer it for you, and privacy, it has to be great to the help -- and then you have to come out in mass.
In a community of 10,000 people, we get 200 clients.
Can you imagine a community of 400 people, the intelligence and passion?
What do you talk about is this morning ...
local people -- that's what you have <unk>
So what I tell you is that the entrepreneurial spirit is where it is.
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution <unk> fossils -- and one moment to another, we have systems that are not sustainable.
The internal combustion engine is not sustainable.
<unk> as a way to sustain <unk> is not sustainable.
What we have to consider, is how do we <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and communicate to seven billion people, in a sustainable way.
There is no technology to do it.
Who is going to invent technology for the green revolution, <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk>
They're the entrepreneurs and they're doing it now.
There's a lovely story that was in a <unk> magazine many, many years ago.
There was a group of experts who were invited to discuss the future of New York City in <unk>
And in the year <unk> brought together this group of people, and <unk> about what would happen to the city of New York City in 100 years, and the conclusion was <unk> New York City wouldn't exist within 100 years.
Why? Because they looked at the curve and <unk> if the population is keeping this <unk> to move to the population of New York to the <unk> <unk> six million horses, and the manure produced by six million horses would be impossible to address.
They were already <unk> in dung.  And so in <unk> they were <unk> this dirty technology that <unk> life in New York City.
So what happens? In the next 40 years, in 1900, in the United States appeared -- <unk> companies <unk>
And the idea of finding a different technology was absolutely <unk> and there were very few factories in <unk> places.
<unk> Michigan. Henry Ford.
And yet, there's a secret to work with entrepreneurs.
First of all, you have to give you <unk>
Otherwise they won't come to speak with you.
Then, you have to give you an absolute <unk> <unk>
And then you get to tell you the truth about <unk>
The smaller company, the largest company has to be able to do three things -- the product that you want to be able to sell has to be fantastic, you have to have a fantastic marketing -- and you have to tell with a great financial administration.
You know what?
We've never met a single human being in the world that can be able to do, sell and look for the money alone.
It doesn't exist.
This is still not born.
We have looked at the 100 <unk> iconic world <unk> <unk> <unk> Ford, all the new companies -- Google, <unk>
There's only one thing that all of the success companies in the world have common -- only one: one was started by one person.
And the word <unk> 32 times.
He wasn't just when it began.
Nobody starts a company alone. Nobody.
So we can create the community where we have <unk> who come from a small business environment in <unk> in <unk> along with their dedicated <unk> who will do for you, what someone did for this gentleman who talk about this <unk> somebody who asks you, what needs to do for you.
What can you do? Can you do it?
Well, you can <unk> it can look for the <unk>
"Oh, no, I can't do that." You see you <unk>
We activate communities.
Thank you.
Those are around us in a lot of ways to improve our lives.
We don't know all the neighbors, so we don't change a lot of knowledge in spite of sharing the same public spaces.
Over the last few years, I've tried to share more with my neighbors in public space, with simple tools like <unk> <unk> and chalk.
These projects came out of questions like, how much do my neighbors do for their <unk>
How can we pay and borrow more things without calling the door to a bad moment?
How do we share more memories of our abandoned buildings and better understand our <unk>
How do we share more of our hopes to the empty stores so that our communities can be able to reflect on our needs and dream today.
I live in New York City, and I'm in love with New <unk>
My soul is always relief with the giant <unk> that they bring into <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> for centuries and I trust a city.
That always gives the music to the music.  The city has one of the most beautiful architecture in the world, but also one with the largest number of abandoned properties.
I live near this house and thought about how it could turn into a rather nice space for the neighborhood and also something that changed my life forever.
In 2009, I lost someone who loved a lot.
It was <unk> like a mother to <unk>
Her death was sudden and unexpected.
I thought a lot about death and <unk>
And this produced a profound gratitude for the time lived and lived in time.
He gave him clarity of my life meaningful life.
But let's stop to keep this look in my everyday life.
It seems to me that it's easy to be able to catch on the day and forget what's really important for you.
So with the help of old and new friends, my friends transformed the wall of this giant house on a giant board, and he painted on her phrases for <unk> after they die.
So the <unk> could take a <unk> thinking about their lives and share personal aspirations in public space.
I didn't know what to wait for this experiment, but the next day the wall was <unk> and still <unk>
And I'd like to share some things that people wrote on the wall.
Before I die. I want to be <unk>  Before I die. I want to sit at <unk> in the line of <unk>
Before she died, I want to sing for millions of people."
Before she died, I want to plant a <unk>
Before she died, I want to live outside the <unk>
Before she died, I want to give you once more."
Before she died, I want to go to the <unk>
Before she died, I want to be completely myself."
This abandoned space became <unk> and the dreams and hope of people made me laugh at <unk> and they gave me comfort in hard times.
It's about knowing that you're not alone. It's about understanding our neighbors in new ways, it's about to accommodate the reflection and the <unk> and to remember what is most important for us as we grow and <unk>
This happened last year and I started getting hundreds of other messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall in their community.
And so with my colleagues in the center of civic center, we did a kit and now they've made walls in countries around the world, like <unk> South Africa, Argentina and beyond.
And together we proved the power of our public spaces if they give us an opportunity to express ourselves and share each other.
Two of the most valuable things we have is the time and our relationships with other people.
In our age of distractions increasing, it's more important than ever, find the ways of conserving perspective and remembering that life is brief and fragile.
death is something that we often avoid talking about, or even thinking, but I understood that prepare for death is one of those things that we get more power.
If you think about death -- we would have our life.
Our shared spaces can be better reflect on what matters as individuals and community and more media to share hopes and stories and stories, people around us, cannot only help improve places, can help improve our lives.
Thank you.
Thank you.
I have a only request.
Please don't tell me I'm normal.
Now I'd like to introduce my siblings.
<unk> is 22 years old, it's very <unk>
We don't talk about, but it transmits joy that some of the best speakers.
<unk> knows what love.
You share it -- it turns out what happens.
It's not <unk> You don't look at the color of the skin.
It doesn't care about religious differences and notice it has never been <unk>
When singing songs from our childhood, trying to say the words I don't even know -- it reminds me of one thing: the little thing we know about the mind and how wonderful it must be the unknown.
Samuel has 16 years old. It's very <unk>
<unk> the <unk> memory.
But it's a selective memory.
It doesn't remember if I stole my <unk> but it reminds me of the year when every single songs of my iPod, <unk> conversations that we did when I was four years old, I would like to do in my arm during the first episode of the <unk> and the Lady of Lady <unk>
You don't seem amazing?
But most people don't agree with it.
And in fact, because their minds don't fit into the concept of normal society, often they're <unk> and <unk>
But what propelled my heart and <unk> my soul was that even if that was the case, if you wouldn't consider it within the <unk> that could only mean one thing: which was <unk> autistic and extraordinary.
Now, for those most familiar term with the term <unk> is a complex brain disorder affecting social communication, learning and sometimes the physical skills.
In each individual becomes different in a different way, and that's where it is so different to Sam.
And all over the world, every 20 minutes, they will be diagnosed with a new case of autism, and even though it's one of the development disorders that faster in the world, there is no cause or <unk>
I don't remember my first encounter with autism, but I don't remember one day without him.
I had only three years when my brother came to the world, and I was very excited to have a new way in my life.
When you spend a few months, I realized he was different.
<unk> a lot.
I didn't want to play like the other babies and, in fact, it didn't seem very interested in me at all.
<unk> living and <unk> in his own world, with their own rules, and I found pleasure in the smallest things, like putting the car in row around the room, looking at the washing machine and eating anything that would have <unk>
As I grew up, it became more different, and the differences were made more <unk>
But beyond the <unk> the frustration and the hyperactivity is endless there was something really <unk> a pure and innocent nature of a child who saw the world without <unk> a human being that had never been <unk>
<unk>
I can't deny that there have been some hard moments in my family, moments when I wish they were just like me.
But I look back to the things that have taught me about Alzheimer's communication and love, and I realize that they're things that I wouldn't want to change the normal.
<unk> is true of the beauty that gives us the differences and the fact of being different doesn't mean that any one is wrong.
It just means there's a different vision of what is correct.
If I could <unk> one thing to <unk> and Sam and you would be that you don't have to be normal.
They can be extraordinary.
Because, autistic or not, the differences that <unk> are a <unk> Every one of us has a gift in your inner and, honestly, the quest for normal, is the last sacrifice of the potential.
The opportunity for <unk> progress and change dies at the time when we try to be like others.
Please. Don't tell me I'm normal.
Thank you.
Five years ago, I experienced a little bit what must have been <unk> at the country of <unk>
Penn State he asked me a teacher, a communications, who gave a kind of communication to engineering students.
I was scared.  <unk> of these students with his great minds, their great books and their big, unknown words.
But in the developing those conversations, I felt what <unk> must have felt when he fell through the <unk> hole and saw the door of a new world.
I just sat down when I had these conversations with the students. I was surprised that they had, and I wanted others to experience this wonderful world.
And I think the key to opening that door is a big communication.
We desperately need a great communication of our scientists and engineers in order to change the world.
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are attacking our larger challenges from energy to the environment and health care and health care, each other, and we don't know what we understand about this, the work is not done, and I think it's our responsibility as not scientists to have these interactions.
But these big conversations cannot happen if our scientists and engineers are not invited to see their wonderful world.
So scientists and engineers, please go back with <unk>
I want to share some suggestions about how you can do it to make sure that your science is sexy and his engineering is attractive.
First question for <unk> and then what?
<unk> why science is relevant to us.
Don't tell us that they study the <unk> but they study the <unk> that are the mesh structure of our bones because it's important to understand and treat <unk>
And when you're describing their science, care about <unk>
The slang is an obstacle to our understanding of their ideas.
Sure, you can say <unk> and <unk> but why not say <unk> and <unk> which is much more accessible to us?
<unk> accessible is not the same thing as <unk>
On the contrary, as Einstein said, it's all as simple as possible, but not simple.
They can clearly communicate their science without engaging ideas.
One thing to consider is to use examples, stories and analogies -- are ways of <unk> and <unk> with their content.
And by presenting his work, forget about the signs of <unk>
Have you been asked by what they're called <unk>  What do the <unk> the bullets are killed, and they give them your presentation.
A <unk> like this is not boring, but it's being supported too much in the area of the language of our brain and <unk>
Instead, this <unk> example of <unk> Brown is much more effective, it shows that the special structure of <unk> is so strong that it really inspired the unique design of the <unk> Tower, <unk>
The trick here is to use a simple statement, which is that the audience can understand if you lose a little bit, and then you will provide graphics that will bring into our other senses, and they believe a deeper sense of understanding what they are <unk>
I think these are just a few key ones that can help others to open the door and see the country of the wonders that's science and engineering.
And so, scientists and engineers, when you've solved this equation, for all media, <unk> with <unk>  Thank you.
One of my favorite words from the entire Oxford English <unk> is <unk>
Just because it sounds pretty good.
And <unk> means <unk> <unk>
Although there was an editor of the 19th century that defined it a lot better when he said, "A <unk> is the reason for a public deal with no matter of <unk> or principle, and that, when he <unk> you get a monumental use of a monumental <unk>
I have no idea what it means.
One thing to do with the words, I guess.
It's very important that words are the basis of politics, and that all politicians know that they have to try to dominate the language.
It wasn't <unk> for example, that the British Parliament allowed the newspapers to quote the exact words that were told in the <unk> chamber.
And all of this was because of the courage of a guy with the <unk> name of <unk> <unk> who was faced with <unk>
They put her in the London Tower of London and he was <unk> but he had enough courage to deal with them, and at the end he had such popular support in London that I won.
And just a few years later we had the first recorded use of the phrase <unk> <unk> as well as the <unk>
Most people think it's literally.
It's not. It's for a <unk> of the freedom of expression.
But to really show you how words and politics interact, I want you to go back to the U.S., just after independence.
So they had to address the question of how to call George Washington, his leader.
You didn't know.
How do you call the leader of a <unk> country.
This is <unk> in Congress for a very long time.
They were introduced all kinds of suggestions that could be <unk>
Some of them wanted to call <unk> <unk> and others, "Your <unk> George <unk> and other <unk> from the <unk> of the U.S. <unk>
Not very <unk>
Some of them just wanted to call it <unk>
They thought it was to be tested quality.
And not even with that, they were <unk> they had the idea that you could be chosen King for a given date.
And I could have <unk>
The whole world got tired of <unk> because this debate was going on for three weeks.
I read the newspaper of a poor <unk> and always <unk> it with this <unk>
Which caused the <unk> and <unk> was that the House House was against the <unk>
The House of Representatives didn't want Washington to be <unk> of power.
They didn't want to call him King for if he was just giving him to him or his designated ideas.
So they wanted to give the <unk> more <unk> and more unfortunate and more unfortunate than they came in.
And that title was <unk>
President. They didn't invented the title. There was no longer before, but it just meant <unk> -- that <unk> a <unk>
It was like the president of a jury.
And I didn't have much more <unk> than the term <unk> or <unk>
There was a <unk> of small <unk> <unk> and <unk> of government, but it was really a insignificant.
And so the Senate is <unk>
They said, "It's ridiculous, we can't call it <unk>
"This guy has to sign treated and meet with <unk> <unk>
"And who would take a serious degree with a <unk> and <unk> like President of <unk>
And finally, after three weeks of debate, the Senate didn't exist.
We can learn three interesting things about this stuff.
First of all, and this is my favorite to where I've been able to figure out, the Senate has never been <unk> the President.
President Barack Obama is lucky to keep there, waiting for the Senate between action.
The second thing that we can learn is that when a government says that a measure is <unk>  <unk> possible that we keep waiting for <unk> years.
But the third thing we can learn, and this is most important, and this is most important, and I want to tell you -- is that the President of the United States is that the President of the United States doesn't sound so modest today, right?
And especially if you have more than 5,000 nuclear warheads to find the largest economy in the world and a fleet of <unk> and so on.
The reality and history have endowed with <unk>
So at the end I won the <unk>
<unk> his title of <unk>
And also the other concern of the Senate, would look good, you know, it was a uniqueness at the time.
But you know how many nations have now <unk>
And all because they want to sound like the guy who has the 5,000 nuclear heads and so on.
So, at the end of the Senate won and the House of <unk> because no one is going to feel humble when you tell you that now are the President of <unk>
And I think that's the great lesson we can learn, and that I would like to <unk>
Politicians are trying to choose and use the words to shape and control reality, but actually really change a lot more the words that these might change reality.
Thank you very much.
I'm 45 at <unk> in an illegal mine in Ghana.
The air is loaded with heat and dust and hard to breathe.
I feel the touch of body bodies in the dark, but I can't see a lot more.
I hear voices who talk about but, of all, that cacophony of <unk> male and rocks are <unk>
As the other -- I have a cheap <unk> <unk> <unk> on the head with this rubber elastic and I can barely distinguish the <unk> branches that hold the walls of that hole in that hole that drops hundreds of feet on the ground.
It was <unk> my hand and suddenly I remember a <unk> I met a <unk> who lost control and dropped countless meters in that well.
As I talk to you today, these guys are at the deep of that hole at that hole in their lives without paying a reward, and often dying.
And I went home and went home but they may never do it because they are <unk>
In the last 28 years, I was documenting native cultures in over 70 countries in six continents, and in 2009, I had the great honor of being the only <unk> in the Peace <unk>
Among all the amazing people I met there was a <unk> <unk> <unk> the <unk> a NGO who's set up to eradicate modern slavery.
We started talking about slavery and, really, I started learning about slavery because I knew there was there in the world but not about grade.
When we ended up talking to me I was very sad, I was honestly <unk> to ignore this <unk> of our days and I thought, if I don't know, how many people don't know?
He made me a stomach <unk> and weeks later, I flew to Los Angeles to meet the director of <unk> the <unk> and I offer my help.
So I started my journey to modern slavery.
Interestingly, I had been in many of these places.
Some of you even considered it my second home.
But this time, <unk> the dirty <unk>
A conservative calculation says that there are more than 27 million people living in the world.
It's twice the number of African people across the entire amount of slaves to <unk>
150 years ago, the cost of a farmer farmer was about three times the annual salary of a U.S. worker.
The equivalent of about 50,000 dollars today.
And yet, today you can save entire families by generations per capita debt for 18 dollars.
Amazingly, slavery generates profit from over 13 billion dollars a year across the world.
Many have been <unk> with false promise of good education and better work to find that they are forced to work without pay, under threat and cannot escape.
Today slavery operates in <unk> goods produced by slaves have value, but those who produce them are disposable ones.
<unk> exists in almost everyone else, and yet it's illegal around the world.
In India and Nepal, I met the bricks.
This strange and formidable show was like entering the old Egypt or the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> at a temperature of 54 degrees -- men, women, children, in fact, entire families <unk> in a heavy cloak of <unk> mechanically mechanically mechanically mechanically slime.
<unk> by the <unk> and the <unk> work in silence, doing this task again and again for 16 -- 17 hours a day.
There was no breath to eat, no to drink, and <unk> and severe <unk> would make it be pretty <unk>
So <unk> were the heat and the dust that my camera became too warm to touch and stopped working.
Every 20 minutes I had to run the car to clean the team and make it work with air conditioning for <unk> and, sitting there, I was thinking, like, my camera gets a lot better treatment than these people.
I wanted to cry at the furnaces I wanted to cry but the <unk> which was on my side and he said, <unk> don't do it. Don't do it here."
And he explained to me very clearly that proving emotions is very dangerous in places like this, not just for me but for them.
I couldn't offer you any direct aid.
I couldn't give them money, nothing.
I wasn't the citizen of that country.
It could put them in a worse situation than they were.
I had to rely on <unk> the <unk> and to work within the system for his liberation and he trusted that he <unk>
As far as me, I waited for getting home to feel my heart <unk>
In the Himalayas, I found kids running rocks for miles on the ground to the trucks that were waiting down.
Those big <unk> were more heavy than the children that the housing and the children would put them into their heads with <unk> <unk> made out of clubs, ropes and <unk>
It's hard to see something so <unk>
How can we influence something so <unk> but so <unk>
Some people don't even know that they're slaves -- and I work 16 or 17 hours a day without <unk> because this has been all their life.
They have nothing with the <unk>
When these villagers <unk> his freedom, the <unk> <unk> <unk>
When you hear the word <unk> we often think about sexual traffic and because of this global awareness of this global awareness that would be difficult for me to work with security in this particular business.
In <unk> I was fascinated by women who had been previously previously been infected with sex.
It was led to me on a few steps that gave this liquid <unk> <unk>
It wasn't exactly a <unk>
It was a restaurant.
<unk> as it is known in the craft, they're local for <unk>
They have small, private rooms, where the <unk> <unk> with their girls and children, some of just seven years -- are forced to entertain clients and to encourage them to buy more food and alcohol.
Each is dark and <unk> identified by a number painted on the wall and divided by a <unk> and a curtain.
The workers often suffer sexual abuse to their clients.
On the <unk> I remember feeling a sense of <unk> <unk> and, in that instant, I could barely imagine what it must be stuck in <unk>
I just had a <unk> the stairs where he <unk>
There was no <unk>
There was no windows big enough to <unk>
Those people don't have <unk> and, because you touch a very difficult issue, it's important to point out that slavery even sex traffic is going around us.
There are hundreds of <unk> people in agriculture, in <unk> in the domestic service, and the list can continue.
Recently, the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 300,000 children are sold every year as sex slaves are sold every year.
It is everywhere, but we don't see.
<unk> are another activity that often relate to the labor of <unk>
I went to Indian villages where there was entire families in the trade of silk <unk>
This is a family portrait.
The black hands are the father, the <unk> of blue and red, from their children.
<unk> <unk> in these big barrels and the silk in the liquid to the <unk> but <unk> is toxic.
My performer told me his stories.
"We have no <unk> they said.
We still hope, though, be able to get out of this house someday and go to another place where we really pay our job."
It's estimated that there are more than 4,000 children in Lake <unk> the largest lake in the world.
When we arrived, I was going to have a quick look.
I saw what appeared to be a <unk> family on a boat, two bigger brothers, some younger children -- some more young kids, it makes sense.
<unk> They were all slaves.
Kids are separated from their <unk> families and forced to work <unk> a lot of these boats in the lake, even though they don't know swimming.
This child is eight years old.
When our boat came up to me was <unk> that his little canoe was <unk>
I was paralyzed by the fear of falling into the water.
The branches of the trees plunged into Lake <unk> often trap networks and children, <unk> and <unk> is thrown into the water to unlock the branches.
A lot of them <unk>
Since remember, it's always been forced to work in the lake.
For fear of his love is not going to flee and, like all the life has been treated with cruelty, <unk> is about the younger slaves under their command.
I met these guys at five o'clock in the morning, when they <unk> the last networks, but they had been working from the one of the day.
<unk> and <unk>
And you can point out that these networks weigh over 400 pounds when they're packed with fish.
I want to introduce you to <unk>
Kofi was rescued in a village of fishermen.
I met him in a refuge where <unk> the <unk> <unk> the victims of <unk>
Kofi is possible.
Who will be because somebody decided to make a difference in your life?
<unk> by a road in Ghana with <unk> <unk> the <unk> a fellow <unk> with his motorcycle suddenly sped up and <unk> our car and played the window.
They asked us to put it through a land road to the jungle.
At the end of the road, we got to go out of the car, and he asked the driver to go out quickly.
Then you signal this path path to just visible and said, "This is the track, this is the path.
As we started to go down, we took the <unk> that <unk> the way and after walking around an hour we found that the way was <unk> by the recent <unk> so I put the pictures of photos on my head as I put it in these waters to the chest.
After two hours of <unk> the <unk> the way ended up <unk> in one of course, and we had in front of a mass mass that could fit into a soccer field, and they were all full of workers enslaved.
A lot of women had kids strapped into their backs and their backs for gold, <unk> in the waters <unk> with <unk>
The <unk> is used in the process of <unk>
These miners are <unk> in a well in another part of Ghana.
When they came out of the pump, they were <unk> on their own sweat.
I remember he looked at his tired, <unk> eyes because many had been under land for 72 hours.
<unk> have to 90 meters, and these people carry heavy stone bags that would be attached to another area in which they had the rock to be able to extract the gold.
And the site seems to be a place that seems to be full men and <unk> but if you look at more close to the margin -- we see the other less lucky and also children.
They're all victims of injuries, diseases and violence.
In fact, it's very likely that this <unk> ends up like this victim of tuberculosis and <unk> for <unk> in a few years.
This is <unk> When his father died, his uncle took it to work with him in the mines.
When he died their uncle, he was <unk> the debt of the uncle was going to be a slave at mines.
When I met him, she had worked in the mines 14 years and the spinal injury that you see here is a product of an accident in the <unk> so serious that the doctors said it should be <unk>
In addition to that, <unk> has tuberculosis, and yet to that, it's forced to work night and day in that mine.
Yet, he has to be liberated and educated with local activists for local activists like <unk> the <unk> and this is this kind of determination, of face to a remote, which inspires me as much respect.
I want to throw light on slavery.
Did you know that their images would be seen by you all over the world.
I wanted you to know that we will bring testimony to them and to do everything possible to help change their lives.
I really believe that if we can see each other as human beings, then it makes it very difficult to be <unk> like <unk>
These images are not of <unk> they're from people, real people, like you, and like me, who deserve the same rights, dignity and respect in their lives.
There's no day if I don't think about these beautiful people, beautiful people, I've had the great honor to meet.
I hope that these images wake up a force in which you see them -- in people like you, and I hope that the force will turn out a fire and that <unk> light on slavery because without that light, the beast of slavery can continue to live in the shadows.
Thank you very much.
I make math happen, and there is a particular problem for whom <unk> are like the management <unk>
No one knows what the hell we do.
So today, I'm trying to tell you what I do.
dance is one of the most human <unk>
We were <unk> the <unk> of the <unk> and the dancers of <unk>  that we'll see more ahead.
But the <unk> demand a degree of extraordinary training -- a high level of dexterity and probably some initial <unk> that may well have a genetic component.
Unfortunately, neurological disorders such as Parkinson's percent of Parkinson's success, gradually this extraordinary ability to do with my friend <unk> <unk> who, at his time, was a virtuous dancer <unk>
Over the last few years, it's made a lot of progress in the treatment.
However, there are <unk> millions of people in the world who are sick, and they have to deal with a <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and other symptoms of this disease, so we need objective tools to detect the disease before it is too late.
We need to be able to measure progress in an objective way and ultimately the only way we know if there is really a cure to be when we have an objective measuring and <unk>
But it's frustrating that for Parkinson's and other disorders of the movement are not biological markers, and that's why the blood analysis and the best we have is a neurological exam of 20 minutes.
You have to go to a clinic to do that. It's very, very expensive, and that means that it was from clinical trials, they never do.
And what if patients could do it at home?
That would save a trip to the clinic. What if patients could do the test they could get ourselves?
It wouldn't be personal.
By the way, it costs about 300 dollars in the neurological clinic.
So what I want to propose to you as a conventional <unk> for a try, you see, in a sense, all of us are <unk> like my friend <unk> <unk>
This is a video of the vibration of <unk> <unk>
It shows someone healthy while it emits the sounds of the talk, we can imagine as dancers of a vocal ballet because we have to coordinate all of those vocal organ in order to produce sounds, and we all have the genes needed -- <unk> for example.
And as the <unk> needs an extraordinary training level.
Take the time that leads to a child learning to speak.
From the sound, we can track the position of the vocal chords as you get to, and as well as Parkinson's affects the missing is also affecting the <unk>
On the bottom section of the bottom of the <unk> <unk>
We see the same <unk>
<unk> <unk> weakness and <unk>
The speech becomes more quiet and <unk> after a while, and this is an example of symptoms.
How do you compare these exams based on the voice with the clinical trials -- well, they're both <unk>
The neurological test is not <unk> they both use existing infrastructure.
You don't need to design a whole bunch of hospitals to do it.
They're both accurate. Okay, but also based on voice <unk> are not <unk>
I mean, you can be <unk>
They do very quickly, take about 30 seconds as a lot.
They're very minimal and we all know what happens to happen.
And when something takes a cost of it as <unk> it turns on mass scale.
These are some amazing goals to address.
We can reduce the market <unk>
I wouldn't do need to go to the clinic for <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> we could get targets.
We could do a low-cost mass <unk> for clinical trials and for the first time, <unk> <unk> on the general scale.
We have the opportunity to start looking for the first <unk> of disease before it is too late.
And so when I have the first steps in that way, we are launching the Parkinson's <unk> <unk>
Together with <unk> and <unk> we want to record a lot of voices around the world to collect enough data and start to tackle these targets.
We have local local lines for about 750 million people in the world.
<unk> with or without Parkinson's or without Parkinson's -- it can call the price of a few cents. And I'm pleased to announce that we've already reached six percent of the goal in only eight hours.
Thank you.   Tom Rielly: So <unk> taking all of these samples of, let's say 10 people, you can say who's healthy and who doesn't?
What are you going to get out of these <unk>
Max <unk> Yeah, yeah. What happens is that during the call you have to indicate if you have or not the disease. Of course.
<unk> You see, some people may not be <unk> You may not know it.
But we're going to get a very big sample of data <unk> in different circumstances, and do it in different circumstances is important because we're looking for <unk> the confusion of confusion in search for real markers of disease.
TR: Do you have a <unk> <unk> at this moment?
Let's have a lot more than that.
Actually, my student <unk> I have to have that <unk> has done a fantastic work, and now it has shown that it works on the mobile phone network also, what you can do the project. Now we have a 99 percent accuracy.
TR: <unk> and nine. Well, it's a improvement.
<unk> Absolutely.
TR: Thank you very much. Max <unk> public.
<unk> Thank you, <unk>
Before March of March 2011, I was doing <unk> in New York City.
We are creatures <unk> gray.
We were terrified in the dark, in <unk> rooms and usually, we avoid the solar light.
We do the thin models -- even more <unk> the perfect <unk> the perfect even as we can and <unk> in the press all the time, but some of us are really artists with a lot of the experience and a real taste of the images and photography.
On March 11, 2011, I saw from my house, just like the rest of the world, the <unk> events that were happening in Japan.
Shortly after that, an organization where it was <unk> there was <unk> -- was in the place working as part of the response team.
I, along with hundreds of other volunteers knew that we couldn't stay home, so I decided to join the group for three weeks.
On the 13th of May I traveled to <unk>
It's a little <unk> village sitting in the <unk> <unk> of almost 50,000 people, one of the first people affected by the wave.
The level of water has reached over 24 feet tall and more than three miles ground inside.
As you can imagine, the village was <unk>
It took the rubble of channels and <unk>
<unk> <unk> removed the mud and we leave the lists to be <unk> and <unk>
We took tons and tons of fish fish dead, <unk> <unk> from the local factory.
We were <unk> and we loved it.
And for weeks, both volunteers like neighbors found similar things.
They found pictures and <unk> and cameras and <unk>
They all did the same thing.
<unk> and take them to different places of people around the world to <unk>
It wasn't until I realized that those pictures represented a huge part of the personal losses that people had <unk>
As they were fleeing the <unk> and to save their lives, they had to abandon everything they had.
At the end of my first week I started to help in a <unk> center of the people.
It helped clean toilets -- enormous, huge <unk>
This place turned out to be the place of the village where the center of <unk> <unk> the photos.
And I had the honor that that day I was going to clean up on me to clean the photos.
This was exciting and inspiring, had heard the expression to think beyond the <unk> but it wasn't until further my horizons that something happened.
When I looked at the pictures, I found some that had over a hundred years was still in the lab on the lab, I couldn't help but think like <unk> how to fix that <unk> and to repair that <unk> and knew hundreds of people who could do the same thing.
So that night I got on Facebook, I contacted some of them, and the next morning, the answer was so overwhelming and positive that I knew we had to try.
So we started <unk> the photos.
This was the first of all.
And I wasn't too <unk> but where the water had cracked the face of the girl who had to do with a lot of precision and <unk>
Otherwise, that little girl would not have the same thing itself, and that would be as tragic as I had the photo <unk>
Over time, they came by luck and they got more <unk> and they needed more <unk> so I went into Facebook and <unk> and five days later 80 people in 12 countries volunteered to help.
When I was two weeks old, I had 150 people <unk>
In Japan in July, we were given to <unk> a village to Northern <unk>
Once a week at week we use our scanner in the history of the history of the time we had <unk> where people were going to reclaim their photos.
The time that we <unk> in <unk> is a different story, depended on the <unk> of the photos.
It could do an hour -- it could make a couple of weeks.
It could make months months.
This <unk> had to draw almost by hand using a guide to the areas that color and detail the water was not destroyed.
It took a lot of time.
The water destroyed all of these photos, it takes out of bacteria, with algae <unk> with algae and even oil, and it was all that with the step of the time I continue to <unk> so I was going to have a very important part of the project.
We couldn't afford the photo unless it was clean and dry and had been <unk> by his <unk>
We had luck with <unk>
We have the guidance of a <unk>
It's very easy to harm even more the photos already <unk>
As he said once <unk> the leader of my group is like making a tattoo.
You can't make mistakes.
The woman who brought us these pictures was lucky in relation to the photos.
And I had started to <unk> herself but stopped to realize that the <unk> even more.
I had <unk>
Without them, the images of her husband and his face would not have been able to put the images into a single photo and <unk> the full picture.
When they picked up their photographs they shared some of their history with us.
A few colleagues of his husband found pictures in a firemen station between the rubble quite far away from where he used to be his house, but his colleagues <unk>
The tsunami, his husband was the experimenter to close the barriers to the wave.
It had to go inside the water while the <unk> <unk>
Her kids -- not so small now, but their two children were in school in different schools.
One of them was trapped in the water.
It took him a week to find his family and know that everybody had survived.
The day I gave her photos his son his youngest son was 14.
For her, despite all of this, those pictures were the best gift I could <unk> something that he could go back to look, something that could remember from the past day that it didn't have been marked by that day from March when everything in his life changed or was destroyed.
After six months in Japan 1,100 volunteers had joined there -- hundreds of them were helped to clean up on <unk> photographs, and the big <unk> -- most of them became the hands of their <unk> <unk>
Over 500 volunteers all over the world helped us bring back to 90 families -- hundreds of photos were completely <unk> and <unk>
During this time, we actually don't spend more than 1,000 dollars in teams and materials, most ink to <unk>
We take photos all the time.
A picture is a memory of someone or something, a relationship, somebody loved it.
They are <unk> of our memories and stories, the last thing that we would do but the first thing that they would look for.
This is the project, to restore little bits of humanity, to give back someone their connection with the past.
When a picture like this comes back to someone, it's a huge difference in the life of the person who receives it.
This project also made a big difference in the life of <unk>
Some of them connected with something bigger -- to give back something, using their talent for something that are not models of perfect skin.
I would like to read this email -- he sent him Cindy the day I came back from Japan after six months.
While I couldn't avoid thinking about people and the stories shown in the imagery.
One in particular, a photo with women from different ages from the grandmother to the little girl, <unk> around a baby, and I was struck by a baby, because a similar picture of my family my grandmother, my mother, and my <unk> daughter hangs out of our wall.
In the whole world, in all the few of our basic needs are the themselves, right?
Thank you.  <unk>
<unk> <unk> inspired us to wonder and curiosity with this photo of a bullet running through an apple on an exhibition of just one of a second.
But now, 50 years later, we can go a million times faster and see the world not for a million or a thousand million, but a trillion frames per second.
I present a new type of <unk> the <unk> a new technical technique that can create videos on a slow camera of light moving.
And with that we can create cameras that can look at the <unk> beyond the line of vision, or see the inside of the body without using X-ray X-ray and challenge the camera idea.
If I take a laser pointer and I switch it and put it into a <unk> <unk> in a number of <unk> to make a <unk> package of photons just a millimeter long.
And that package of photons, that <unk> travel at the speed of light, and again, a million times faster than a common bullet than a commons.
If we take that bullet and this package of photons and we put it into this bottle, how do they disperse those photons into this <unk>
What is the light aspect of light in <unk>
Now, all this --   Remember that all this happens in less than a <unk> is what it takes to travel the light.
But this video is 10 billion times slower so you can see the light in motion.
Coca-Cola is not going to do a lot of things in this <unk> <unk> this information to show what's going on.
The pulse, our <unk> comes into the bottle with a package of photons that starts to <unk> and that, inside, starts to <unk>
Part of the light is <unk> it goes to the table, and we started to see these <unk>
Many of the photons finally get to the cap and then explode in various directions.
As you can see, there's a bubble of air that bounces off the inside.
At that time, the waves travel on the table and because of the reflections of the top you see in the bottom of the bottle, and after several boxes, that the reflections were <unk>
Now, if we take a common <unk> and we make it <unk> the same distance and we see it in slow motion to about 10 billion times, how much you think it would take us to see that film?
A week?
It would be a very boring movie  from a slow <unk>
And what about <unk> <unk>
You can see the waves out of the table of the tomato thing, and the bottom wall.
It's like throwing a rock into a pond.
It's the way nature looks a picture, I was thinking about a <unk> at the time, but of course, our eyes see a full composition of it.
But if you look at a bit more like this, you'll realize that, as the light gets closer to tomato sauce, it is still <unk>
Why? Because the tomato is <unk> and the light bounces on its inside and it comes back after several <unk> of a second.
In the future, when this <unk> is in your cell phone, you're going to be able to go to the supermarket and verify if the fruit is grown without having to <unk>
Why do we create this camera at <unk>
As photographers, you know, if we take a picture at low exposure, it comes into very little light.
But we're going to go a billion times faster than the <unk> <unk> so just to go into some light.
<unk> that <unk> that package of photons, millions of times, and we recorded over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over and over the <unk> of data and <unk> <unk> to create those <unk> that I showed you.
We can take all of these data in crude and make it interesting ways.
Superman can fly.
Other heroes can become invisible <unk>
And if a new power of a future will be able to see it after the <unk>
The idea is that we could throw a little bit of light on the door, you get into the room, one part is going to reflect on the gate, and from the camera, to the camera.
We could extract those multiple light <unk>
It's not science fiction. We've already built.
On the left, is our <unk>
Behind the wall is a bicycle and <unk> the light in the door.
After the publication of our article in Nature <unk>
And a small fraction of the photons will return to the camera, but interestingly, in moments slightly different.
And as we have a camera that works like that quickly, our <unk> has unique solutions.
It has very good time resolution. And you can look at the world at the speed of light.
So we know the distances all the way up to the door and also to the hidden objects, but we don't know what about it is to be aware of what a distance.
So when a laser can record a picture of <unk> you see on the screen, it doesn't really make any sense.
But we're going to take a lot of images like this, dozens of images, and we're going to try and try to analyze the multiple <unk> of light, and with that, we can see the <unk> object.
Can we see that 3D <unk>
This is our reconstruction.
We have things to explore before you pull this out of the lab, but in the future, we could create cars that are <unk> collisions with what is around the curve,
Or we could look for survivors in dangerous conditions, looking at the light reflected by the open windows of it.
Or we could build <unk> able to see the inside of the body through <unk> and the same for the <unk>
But, of course, because of the fabric and the blood that is quite hard, so this is actually a request for scientists to start thinking about <unk> like a new visualization of visualization to solving the problems of the next generation.
So as <unk> <unk> was a scientist, and it turned science into art, an art of photographs <unk>
I realized that all the <unk> of data that we collect every single time is not just for scientific visualization, but we can be able to see it.
It creates a new form of computational photography with slow camera and code of colors.
And let's look at those waves -- remember, time between each of those waves is just a few seconds of a second.
But here's a lot of fun.
If you look at the waves underneath the <unk> these are leaving from us.
The waves should move towards us.
What happens here?
It turns out, as we are recording almost at the speed of light, we have strange effects, I would have loved to see this image.
The order in which the events happen in the world sometimes comes down to the camera.
You know, <unk> corresponding warping of space and time, we can fix this <unk>
That's time. Thank you.

With a mobile phone, you can record a song, you know, <unk> and get famous.
This is all possible with a cell phone.
I'm a <unk> of 1984 and alive in the city of <unk>
Let's go back to that moment to this city.
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people are looking for change.
So this is the fall of 1989. Imagine if all of these people <unk> that you would try and look for a change, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
Who are a mobile phone here?
<unk>
Hands up your cell phone.
<unk> A Android, <unk>
It's a lot. Almost everyone today has a cell phone.
But today, I'm going to talk about me, of my mobile, and how it changed my life.
I'm going to talk about this.
These are 35 <unk> of information.
Natural <unk>
Why is that information there?
Because in the summer of 2006 the E.U. Commission presented a <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This tells you that every European phone company, every single Internet provider in Europe, has to store a wide range of user information.
Who calls who. Who sends an email to who.
Who sends a text to who.
And if we use the mobile, where are we are.
All this information is stored for at least six months, and to two years, in their telephone company, or your Internet provider for the Internet.
And in all Europe people were planted and said, "We don't want this."
They said they didn't want this <unk>
We want the <unk> in the digital age, and we don't want the carriers and the Internet providers -- all this information about us.
There was lawyers, journalists, everybody said, "We don't want this."
And here you can see some 10,000 people who came out to the streets of Berlin and they said, <unk> <unk>
And some of them even said this would be <unk> 2.0.
The <unk> was the secret police of Germany in East Germany.
And I also wondered if this really works.
Can you store all this information about us?
Every time I use the <unk>
So I asked my phone -- <unk> <unk> who at that time was the largest telephone company in Germany, who please get to me all the information that you had about me.
I asked them once, and I went back to wonder, and I didn't get a concrete response, it was all <unk>
But then I said, I want to have this information because you are <unk> my life.
So I decided to have a lawsuit because I wanted to have this information.
But <unk> <unk> said no, we won't give you this information.
At the end of it, I agree.
They would send me the demand and they would send me the information that I <unk>
Meanwhile, the Court <unk> <unk> failed the <unk> for the German law of the E.U.
So I got this ugly on brown with a CD inside.
And the CD had this.
Thirty and five thousand dollars -- 30 information lines.
At the beginning I saw it, and I said, well, it's a huge file. Okay.
But after a time I realized that it's my life.
There are six months of my life in this archive.
It was a little bit <unk> what should I do with that?
Because you can see where I am, where I step at night, what am I doing.
But then I said, I want this information to <unk>
I want to make it public.
Because I want to show people what the <unk>
So, next to <unk> <unk> and Open came City, we did this.
This is a visualization of six months of my life.
You can zoom in and go down, go back and go forward.
You can see every step I do.
And you can see how I go from <unk> on the train to <unk> and what often I call the way.
This is all possible with this information.
That's a little scary.
But it's not just about me.
It's about all of us.
First, there are things like, I call my wife and she calls me, we're talking a couple of times.
Then they call me some friends and they call each other.
And then you call the other, and the other one on the other, and we ended up with this great communications network.
You can see how people communicate with each other to what time they call each other, what time they sleep.
You can see this all this.
You can see the centers, the leaders of the group.
If you have access to this information, you can see what the society is.
If you have access to this information, you can control their society.
This is a model for countries like China and Iran.
This is a model to study the shape of your society, because you know who talks to whom, who sends an email to whom, all this is possible if you have access to this information.
And this information is stored at least six months in Europe, and to two years.
As I said at the beginning, imagine if all of these people in the streets in Berlin, in the fall 1989, they had a cell phone in your pocket.
And the <unk> had known who I was involved in this protest, and if the <unk> had known who the leaders would never have happened.
The fall of the Berlin Wall may never have happened.
And as a result, neither of the <unk> of <unk>
Because today on the state agencies and companies want to store so much information from us as possible in and out of the web.
They want to have the possibility of keeping our lives and they want to be <unk>
But <unk> and living in the digital was not a contradiction.
But today you have to fight for <unk>
You have to fight for that every day.
When they go back home to your friends that privacy is a <unk> of the 21st century, and it's not <unk>
When you go home, they <unk> their representative because business agencies can be able to store some information, they don't have to.
And if you don't believe me, ask your phone company, what information they store from you.
So in the future, every time you use their mobile phones that give them to remember that they have to fight for the <unk> in the digital era.
Thank you.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
It's not enough.
Hi TEDWomen, what happens?
I call <unk> <unk> and I'm not <unk> but I know the doctor that brought me to the world.
<unk> my mom six times in six different ways, <unk> to the poor of me in the process.
As a result, I have cerebral palsy, which is why we <unk> all the time.

It's <unk> I'm like a mixture of <unk>
And Muhammad <unk>
The P. <unk> is not genetics.
It's not <unk> you can't <unk>
No one was <unk> the uterus of my mother and not <unk> because my parents were innocent cousins, even though they are.
It's only about accidents, like the one I came at birth.
Now, I'm going to tell you, I'm not a source of inspiration. And I don't want any of them in the room.
I feel bad for me, because at some point in life, you wish it was <unk>
Come with a ride.
<unk> Christmas, are in the trade center, driving in circles looking for parking spaces, and what do you see?
16 empty places for disabled places.
And they think, "God, I can be at least a little bit <unk>
Also, I tell you, I have a <unk> and P. <unk> is just one of them.
There was a <unk> of <unk> I would win the gold medal.
I'm a <unk> Muslim woman, and I live in New Jersey.
If you don't feel better, maybe you should do it.
I'm from Park <unk> in New Jersey.
I always loved my neighborhood and my disease had the very initial principle.
I also love that if I wanted to walk from my home to New York, it might.
A lot of people with cerebral palsy, not <unk> but my parents don't believe in <unk>
The mantra of my father was, "Can you <unk> <unk> dance.
If my three elderly sisters were <unk> I <unk>
If my three older sisters went to public school, my parents went to the school system, and she was <unk> that I was also out there, and if I didn't take all the top note of the <unk> of my mother.
My father taught me how to walk the five years to put my <unk> on his feet and just walking.
Another approach I used was to hang a dollar in front of me so that it would be <unk>
The <unk> that I carry on was very strong and ...
Yeah. The first day in the kindergarten was walked like a <unk> champion who's received a lot of taps.
Growing up, there was only six Arabs in my city, and they were all of the family.
Now there are 20 Arabic, and they continue to be all the family.  I think nobody realized we weren't <unk>
This was before 9/11, and the politicians would think appropriate to use <unk> to the <unk> like campaign.
The people that I grew up had no problem with my faith.
But it seemed to be a lot of <unk> a lot of dying of starvation during the <unk>
I told them that he had enough fat to live three months without eat, so I <unk> the dawn at sunset it's very easy.
<unk> <unk> in <unk>
Yes, in <unk> it's crazy.  My parents couldn't afford physical therapy, so sent me to the dance.
I learned to dance with <unk> or whether I can walk with <unk>
I'm from New Jersey, and there we want to be <unk> so if my friends used to wear <unk> I was too.
And when my friends were going to spend the summer vacation on the coast of Jersey, I was not going.
I was going through my summers in a war zone, because my parents were afraid if we didn't go back to Palestine all the <unk> we would get rid of the <unk>
On the summer holidays often my father was trying to <unk> so I was drinking <unk> <unk> and I got warm cups on the back, and I remember the water <unk> and I remember the water to me, and I was like, <unk> <unk>
But the <unk> cure was the yoga.
I must say it's very boring, but before I do yoga -- it was a <unk> <unk> that I couldn't stand up. <unk>
And now I can lie in the head.
My parents -- this idea that I could do anything, that no dream was impossible, and my dream was to be at <unk> Hospital.
I went to college through positive discrimination, and I got a grant for the <unk> University of Arizona, because it was in all the <unk>
It was like the pet <unk> of the <unk>
I was all <unk>
I did all the tasks of the least smart, I took the top note in my lectures, and also in their classrooms.
Every time I did a scene from the glass zoo of glass in the glass zoo.
But I never got a role.
Finally, in my last year, the <unk> decided to do a piece called <unk> very slow in Jackson.
It's a work of a girl with cerebral <unk>
I was a girl with cerebral <unk>
So I started shouting at four <unk> <unk> <unk> will have a <unk>
I have <unk>
At the end of the end of the time, they end up.
Thank God <unk> I am finally <unk>
I didn't get the paper.  You gave it to <unk> Brown.
I went to <unk> running to the head of the theater, crying crying like someone had killed my cat, asking me why and she told me that because they thought I couldn't do the risk scenes.
And I said, "Excuse me, if I can't do the risk stunts cannot be <unk>
It was a role for which there was literally born and gave it to an actress without cerebral <unk>
The college was imitating my life.
Hollywood has a <unk> history of <unk> actors without disabled paper.
At <unk> I went home, and my first <unk> <unk> was like extra in a <unk>
My dream became true.
And I knew it would be <unk> from <unk> to <unk> friend <unk> in a <unk>
Instead, I was there like a <unk> I didn't see me more than the <unk> and it was clear to me that the <unk> directors didn't do <unk> actors, but not white, with disabilities.
Just <unk> to perfect people.
But there was exceptions to the rule.
I grew up watching <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and all these women had one thing in common: They were <unk>
So I became <unk>
And in my first tour, I took these famous comics from New York to New Jersey, and will never forget the face of the first comedian that it took when she fell at the account of the <unk> on the <unk> by the New Jersey on a driver that had cerebral <unk>
I worked in clubs all over the U.S., and also in Arabic in the Middle East, without censorship and <unk>
Some people say I'm the first <unk> in the Arab world.
I never like to reclaim the first place, but I know you never heard that little rumor that women are not fun, and they find it very fun.
In 2003, my brother and father, Dean <unk> and I launched the <unk> <unk> Festival in New York City, now on 10 year.
Our goal was to change the negative image of the <unk> in media and to remind them to the <unk> directors that <unk> and Arabic are not <unk>
<unk> the Arab was much easier than fighting against the challenge of disability.
My great opportunity came in 2010.
I was invited to the news show show by Keith <unk>
I walked in as if it was a graduate dance, I went back to a studio and they sat in a wheelchair.
I looked at the middle and I said, "Excuse me, you can give me another <unk>
She looked at me and said, <unk> four, three, <unk>
And we were in <unk>
So I cling at the desk desk so I didn't get out of the screen during the <unk> and when I ended the interview, I was <unk>
I finally had my opportunity and <unk> I knew they wouldn't get me.
But not only Mr. <unk> went back to <unk> but I was just like the <unk> and hit my chair.
Something fun I learned in direct Keith <unk> was that people on the Internet are <unk>
The children are <unk> but they never get rid of me and no longer a little older.
Suddenly, my disability on the Internet became <unk>
I would see clips on the line with comments like, "Why do you <unk>
"It's <unk>
And my favorite <unk>
What disease does it have?
We really should pray for it.
A <unk> suggested even to add my disability to my <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
<unk> is as visual as race.
If somebody in wheelchair can't do <unk> then you can't do somebody in a wheelchair.
<unk> is the <unk> Yes, <unk> <unk>
<unk> are the largest minority of the world, and the most <unk> in the world of entertainment.
The doctors were told that not <unk> but I'm here in front of you.
However, we had grown up with the media, I don't think we <unk>
I hope that together we can create more positive images of disability in media and everyday life.
Maybe if there was more positive images, that -- I just hate it less hate on the Internet.
Or maybe not.
Maybe we still need the whole society to teach our children.
My journey has led me to very spectacular places.
I came up with <unk> by the red carpet <unk> by the <unk> by law Susan <unk> and the infamous <unk> <unk>
I came to act in a film with Adam <unk> and working with my <unk> the incredible Dave <unk>
<unk> the <unk> world is <unk> <unk>
I was <unk> in representation of the great state of New Jersey in the <unk>
And I founded "The <unk> a charity to give the children to Palestinian refugee children, a tiniest part of what my parents gave me.
It was the only time my father saw me alive, and I do this talk to your memory.
<unk> <unk> <unk>
I call it <unk> <unk> and if I can, you can too.
I'd like to tell you a story about a child in a small village.
I don't know his name, but I know his story.
She lives in a small town in the South <unk>
This village is about <unk>
<unk> drives the little town to poverty and the edge of the <unk>
Without anything for him there, it's going to the great city, in this case, <unk> the capital of Somalia.
When it comes there, there are no opportunities, there is no work, and it's not a job <unk>
He has just lived in a tent in the city outside of <unk>
And then maybe a year <unk> nothing.
One day he told you about a guy who offers him to <unk> after dinner, to <unk>
It was a dynamic group of people, which gives you a break.
It gets a little bit of money for you to buy new clothes, money to send your family home.
They presented a young guy.
They finally went home.
It starts a new life.
It has a goal of life.
A beautiful day in <unk> under a blue sky -- a bomb.
That child in that small village with the dreams of the great city was the <unk> terrorist and that dynamic group of people were the <unk> a terrorist organization connected to al Qaeda.
So how does the story of a little kid trying to fulfill their dreams in the city end with him <unk>
He was waiting for.
He was waiting for an opportunity, hoping to start his future, waiting for a future perspective, and this was the first thing he arrived.
This was the first thing that made it out of what we call the <unk> period.
And his story is repeated in urban centers around the world.
It's the story of the <unk> young urban youth who were <unk> in <unk> <unk> riots in London, looking for something beyond the <unk> of <unk>
For the young people, the promise of the city, the great dream of the city is the opportunity, of work, but young people don't participate in the prosperity of their cities.
It's often youth who suffers from the highest rates of unemployment.
By 2030, three of every five people living in cities will be under 18 years.
If we don't include young people in the growth of our cities, if you don't give them opportunities, the history of <unk> <unk> the door to access to terrorism, to violence, to be the story of cities.
And in my city of birth, the 70 percent of the young people are <unk>
70 percent don't work, it's not going to school.
They do nothing.
I went back to <unk> last month, and I went to visit the <unk> Hospital.
I remember to be in front of that hospital <unk> to <unk> thinking, and if I never had gone?
And if I had seen me forced to be in that same <unk> <unk>
It would have become <unk>
I'm not really sure about the answer.
The reason I was in <unk> that month was actually to support the youth leaders in a business altitude.
We went down to about 90 people, youth leaders.
We sat down and we had a rain of ideas about solutions to the big challenges facing the city.
One of the young people in the room was <unk>
He was at the University of <unk> <unk>
There was no work, no opportunity.
I remember when he said to me, that because I was a graduate college university -- frustrated, was the perfect <unk> for Al <unk> and other organizations to be <unk>
They were looking for people like it.
But this story takes a different path.
In <unk> the highest obstacle to one point A is the street.
<unk> years of civil war have destroyed the traffic system, and a motorcycle may be the easiest way to <unk>
<unk> saw an opportunity and <unk>
It started a company of <unk>
It started <unk> <unk> to local residents who were typically couldn't <unk>
I bought 10 <unk> with the help of his family and friends, and his dream is at some point to expand hundreds of motorcycles for the next three years.
Why is this story different?
What does this story do?
I think its ability to identify and leverage a new opportunity.
It's the entrepreneur, and I believe that the business spirit can be the most powerful tool against <unk> <unk>
They were teaching young people to be the creators of economic opportunities that are looking for so much.
And you can train young people to be entrepreneurs.
I want to talk to you about a young man who attended one of my meetings, Mohamed <unk> a <unk>
I was <unk> to train some of the young people at the summit of business and how to be innovative and how to create a culture of business <unk>
In fact, it's the first <unk> that <unk> has seen in over 22 years, and until Mohamed arrived, if you wanted flowers for your <unk> <unk> we were from plastic sent from abroad.
If you ask someone, "When was the last time you saw flowers.
For those who grew up during the civil war, the answer is: <unk>
So, Mohamed saw an opportunity.
It started a company of <unk> and design.
I created a farm on the outskirts of <unk> and he started growing <unk> and <unk> who said, they could survive the hard climate of <unk>
And it started the delivery of flowers flowers, creating gardens in the houses, and the businesses in the city, and now it's working on the creation of the first public park in <unk> in 22 years.
There is no public parks in <unk>
It wants to create a space where families, young people can go together, and, like he says, smell the pink <unk>
By the way, he is not <unk> because they use a lot of water.
So the first step is to inspire young people, and in that room, the presence of Mohamed had a really profound impact on young people.
They had never thought about starting a business.
They had thought about working for an NGO, working for government, but their story, their innovation, really had a strong impact on them.
It forced them to look at their city as a place of opportunities.
The encouraged to believe that they could be entrepreneurs, that could be <unk> of the change.
For the end of the day, they already had innovative solutions for some of the greatest challenges facing the city.
We have business solutions for local problems.
So, I will inspire young people and create a culture of entrepreneurial spirit is really a big way, but the young people need to work to make their ideas reality.
They need experience and guidance to guide them in development and set up with their businesses.
<unk> young people with the resources they need, <unk> the support that they need to move from understanding the understanding of creation, and create <unk> for urban growth.
For me, the business spirit is more than starting a business.
It's creating a social impact.
Mohamed is not just selling flowers.
I think it's selling hope.
Her Park, the <unk> is how it calls it when it is created, when it's created, we transform the way people see their city.
<unk> hired kids from the street to help rent and keep <unk>
It gave them the opportunity to escape from the <unk> of <unk>
These young entrepreneurs are having a tremendous impact on their cities.
So my suggestion is to turn the young people in businesspeople, and they <unk> and <unk> their <unk> innovation, and they will have more stories about flowers and Parks of the Peace <unk> and <unk> in <unk>
Thank you.
I was about 10 years old, and I went to <unk> with my dad in the mountains -- a <unk> area north of the state of New York City.
It was a beautiful day.
The forest is <unk>
The sun was going to make the leaves <unk> like a <unk> and not because of the way that we could just pretend we were the first human beings to step that ground.
We came to our camp.
It was a <unk> in a <unk> beautiful, beautiful lake when I discovered something horrible.
Behind the <unk> there was a <unk> of about four square meters with apple hearts with an apple balls and <unk> <unk>
And I was <unk> I was very angry and incredibly <unk>
The <unk> that were too lazy like to pull out what they had <unk> who thought it was going to clean their <unk>
That question kept with me, and it was <unk>
Who clean our <unk>
No matter how to <unk> or where do we get the <unk> who clean our trash <unk>
Who clean our trash in Rio or in Paris or <unk>
Here in New York City, the Department of <unk> clean our junk -- at 11 tons of waste and <unk> tons of recyclable products every day.
I wanted to know them as individuals.
I wanted to understand who does that work.
What do you feel to use the uniform and bring that <unk>
So I started a research project with them.
I traveled in the trucks and I walked through their pathways, and I interviewed people in office and facilities in the entire city, and I learned a lot, but it was still a <unk>
I needed to get into more.
So I began to work like <unk> of waste.
Now I didn't just travel in trucks. I was <unk>
And operated the <unk> mechanical and <unk>
It was a remarkable privilege and an amazing learning.
They all ask about the smell.
It's there, but it's not as prevalent as you believe -- and in the days that it's very strong -- you get <unk>
It costs a lot of used to the weight.
I met people who had worked on it for several years and their bodies kept <unk> the weight of getting on their <unk> tons of garbage every week.
It's also the danger.
According to the Bureau of <unk> <unk> the collection of waste is one of the most dangerous <unk> in the country, and I learned the reason.
You're coming out and go into the traffic all day and pass it around you.
They just want to <unk> so in general the driver is not paying attention.
That's very bad for <unk>
And the crap itself is full of dangers that often fall off the truck and cause terrible damage.
I learned about how relentless of the trash.
When you go out of the <unk> and you see a city from the back of the truck, you get to understand that the trash is like a force of nature itself.
It never stops coming.
It's like a form of breathing or circulation.
It must always be moving.
And it's also the stigma.
It seems to me that stigma is particularly ironic because I believe that the <unk> of waste are the most important work hand in the streets of the city, for three reasons.
They're the first <unk> of public health.
If you don't get rid of the waste of waste and effectively every day, this starts to <unk> out of its <unk> and its dangers inherent to us in very real ways.
So we had controlled for decades and centuries they have come back and start <unk>
The economics needs it.
If we can't get rid of the old <unk> we don't have room for what the motors in the economy starts to fail when it's in harm's way.
I'm not advocating for capitalism, I just <unk> its relationship.
And then this is what I call our average speed necessary.
This is what I mean by simply at the speed of that used to move into the time <unk>
We don't usually get rid of us and clean up, or we took our coffee cup -- our bag of <unk> our water bottle.
We use them -- forget about them, because we know that there is a work force on the other side that would take out of it.
So today, I want to suggest to you a couple of ways to think about the collection of waste that maybe help reduce the stigma and <unk> in that conversation about how to design a sustainable and human city.
Her work, I think, is almost <unk>
They're on the street every day, <unk>
They use a uniform in many cities.
Do you know when to <unk>
And their work enables us to make our own.
They're almost a form of relief.
The flow that keeps us against us, our own <unk> our <unk> and that flow is always to stay in one form or another.
One day after September 11, 2001 I heard the <unk> of a waste collection truck on the streets, grabbed my little child and went down the stairs I was running the stairs and there was a man doing his way from recycled paper like it did all the <unk>
And I tried to thank you for doing his work that particular day, but I started crying.
And I looked at me and he said, "We're going to be okay.
Let's be okay."
Shortly after that, I started to investigate the collection of waste and I went back to this man.
It's called <unk> we work together many times, and we made good friends.
I want to believe that <unk> was right.
Let's be okay.
But in our efforts for <unk> the way we exist on this planet as a species we have to include and have at account all the costs, even the very real human cost of the labor of work.
The municipal waste that we think when we talk about trash, they represent three percent of the amount of waste from the nation.
It's a remarkable statistic
So in the flow of their days and their lives, the next one you see someone whose work is to clean the trash of you, take a moment to <unk>
<unk> a moment to tell you much.
My work is focused on the connection of thinking about our communal life in a part of the environment where architecture is born naturally from conditions and local traditions.
Today, I brought two recent projects like this.
Both projects are located in emerging countries, one in Ethiopia and the other in Tunisia.
They also share the fact that different analysis from different perspectives become an essential part of the end of the end of architecture.
The first example started with an invitation to design a shopping center in the <unk> capital of Ethiopia, Addis <unk>
This is the kind of building that showed us like example, to my team and me, about what we had to design.
At first, the first thing I thought was, "I want to go out <unk>
And after looking at some of these buildings there are many of these buildings there are many in the city, we realized that there are three important aspects for <unk>
In principle, these buildings are almost empty because they have very large stores that people can't afford to buy things.
Secondly, you need to spend a lot of energy because the lining of the crystals generates heat inside, so you need a lot of <unk>
In a city where this should not happen because it's a temperate climate that goes from 20 to 25 degrees during the entire year.
And thirdly, what has nothing else to do with Africa or Ethiopia.
It's a <unk> <unk> in culture and traditions.
In our first visit to Ethiopia, I was really enchanted with the old market that is this structure at the open air where thousands of people are going and buy things every day to small <unk>
There's also that idea of using public space to generate external activity.
So I thought, that was what I really wanted to design, not a mall.
But the question was how do we build a new building, of several stories, by applying these principles.
The next challenge was presented to the survey of the site that is located in a very much area of the city, where a lot of the buildings that we now see in the picture, not exist.
And it's also between two parallel streets that they communicate in an extension of hundreds of feet.
So the first thing we did was to create a connection between these two blocks of the building.
And this spreads with a atrium atrium -- which creates a space in the free air in the building that was absorbed by its own form, the sun and rain.
And around this space, we've applied the idea of the market with little businesses, which changes on every floor because of the form of space.
I also thought, how close the building?
And I wanted to find a solution that would lead to the local weather conditions.
And I started thinking about a similar tissue of a concrete shell, with <unk> to allow the air to the air and also the light, but in a <unk> fashion.
Then we were inspired by these beautiful buttons of dresses <unk>
They have properties of fractal geometry and this helped me to do the <unk>
We're building that with these little <unk> pieces that are the windows that allow the air and light in a controlled way inside the building.
This is <unk> with these little color crystals that use light from the building to illuminate the building at night.
So with these ideas that was not really easy to convince the developers because they thought, "That's not a mall. It wasn't a mall. It was not what you want.
But at all, we all realized that this idea of the market was much more profitable than the mall because the end of the bank was more local.
And in addition to the facade of the facade was much more economic -- not only because of the material compared to the glass, but also because it was no longer necessary to have air <unk>
So we get certain savings in the budget that we use to implement the project.
The first thing was to think about how to achieve the power of energy for the building in a city where electricity is cut almost every day.
So we got a great advantage to put <unk> on the roof.
And then under those panels we think about the ceiling as a new public space with <unk> and bars that would create this oasis <unk>
And these <unk> on the roof, which is actually collect water for the <unk>
It's waiting for the beginning of the next year, because we go through the fifth ground floor.
The second example is a master of 2,000 apartment and services in the city of Tunisia.
And to make a project that is so big, the greatest that I ever designed, I needed to just understand the city of Tunisia, but also its environment, his tradition and culture.
During that analysis, I got special attention on the <unk> a <unk> structure that was surrounded by a dozen years of access to connected access to <unk>
When I went to the place, the first design operation that we did was to expand the streets and create 12 very similar blocks in size and characteristics that there are in Barcelona and other cities in Europe with these <unk>
In addition to that, we select some of the strategic dots with the idea of the idea of the interconnected <unk> with straight lines, and this changed the initial model.
And the last operation was to think about the cell, the little cell in the project, like the apartment, as an essential part of the master plan.
I thought, what would the best orientation for an apartment in the <unk> climate.
And it's <unk> because it creates a thermal difference between both sides of the house and therefore natural ventilation.
So they <unk> a framework that claims that most of the apartments are perfectly <unk> in that direction.
And this is the result that's almost like a combination of the European block and the Arab city.
It has these blocks with <unk> and then in the low plant we have all the connections to pedestrians.
And it also responds to local norms that set up a greater density at the higher levels and lower density in the lower floor.
And it also reinforces this idea of the doors.
The roof, which is my favorite space of the project is almost like giving up the community the space occupied by construction.
It is where all the neighbors, can you go up and make these activities like running a two miles per morning, or jump from a building to another.
These two examples, have a common approach to design process.
And also, they're in emerging countries, where you can see cities growing.
In these cities, the impact of architecture in the lives of people change the communities and local economies at the same pace that buildings.
For this reason, I see even more important to look at architecture for simple solutions, but <unk> that improve the relationship between the community and the environment and that they have as a goal to connect nature with people.
Thank you very much.
When I was eight years old, a new girl joined our class. It was as remarkable, as you see all the new girls.
He had big amounts of hair very bright and a little <unk> <unk> <unk> It was super strong for the capitals of the states, very good for <unk>
I ended up that year and I was full of <unk> until I was able to make my sinister <unk>
One day I was given a time after the <unk> I was a little afternoon, and I hid in the bathroom of girls.
When the coast was <unk> salt, I entered the classroom, I took off the table of my master's school book.
And then, I did.
I took the ratings out of my <unk> just a little bit, just a few <unk>
All the same --  And I set up to give back the book to the <unk> but to see, some of my other partners had very good notes as well.
So in a <unk> <unk> the notes all over the world, without any imagination.
I put all rows of <unk> and myself a row of the way, just for being there, because I got <unk>
I'm still surprising to what I did.
I don't understand how the idea.
I don't understand why I felt good at it.
I felt important.
I don't understand why I never loved me.
It's that it was all <unk> <unk>
I will never get paid.
But most of all, I was struck by the reason why I was bothered by this <unk> so small, it was so good for <unk>
Would the jealousy.
They're so mysterious and so <unk>
We know that babies suffer from jealousy.
And also the primates. The birds are very <unk>
We know that <unk> are the number one cause of children in the United States.
And yet, I've never seen a study that <unk> the loneliness, or the long duration of the sadness.
And so you have to go to the fiction, because novels are like the lab when you study the <unk> in all their possible forms.
In fact, I don't know if it's an exaggeration to say that if there was no <unk> there would be literature.
You wouldn't have <unk> the <unk> would have no <unk>
There was no King <unk> <unk> <unk> and a <unk>
There was no Shakespeare.
<unk> the <unk> lists of high school, because we would be losing "The <unk> and the <unk> would have no <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Without <unk> there is no <unk> I know it's fashionable to say that <unk> has the answers for everything, and as soon as you have them all of them.
This year they spent 100 years of their <unk> "In <unk> <unk> the most <unk> study of sexual <unk> and also the <unk> <unk> -- everything we could have.  And thinking about <unk> we have the details -- right?
We think in a child trying to reconcile the dream.
We think about a <unk> <unk> in <unk>
We forgot how hard that image.
We forgot how relentless it is.
I mean, this is books that Virginia <unk> said they were as hard as <unk> of cat.
I don't know what the cat, <unk> but we assume it's <unk>
Let's see why they go so well together, the novel and <unk> the <unk> and <unk>
It's going to be very obvious as the <unk> that are reduced to the person -- to their desire, to their <unk> are a narrative <unk>
I don't know. I think we get very close to the bone, when we think about what happens when we feel jealousy.
When we feel <unk> we tell ourselves a story.
A story about other people, and those stories make us feel terrible because they're designed for that, to make us feel bad.
Being storytellers and audience, we know exactly what detail it was <unk> to <unk> the knife yeah?
<unk> do all of all novelists do with <unk> and that's something that <unk> understood.
All that she does to give me pleasure could give it to each other, maybe right now."
And it starts to say to himself that story, and since then, <unk> says that every fresh <unk> that <unk> senses on his lover, it adds up to his collection of instruments of torture in their private camera.
You have to admit that <unk> and <unk> were notoriously <unk>
You know, the <unk> of <unk> would have to abandon the country, if they wanted to break up with it.
But you don't have to be so <unk> to recognize that it's a hard job. Right?
<unk> are <unk>
Is it a <unk> emotion, you have to <unk>
And what are the <unk>
<unk> are <unk> of information.
<unk> use the details.
The <unk> like the big amounts of bright hair and the cute little <unk> of <unk>
The <unk> <unk> from the photos.
That's why Instagram is so successful --  <unk> links good language <unk> with jealousy.
So when you get older, it's in the <unk> agony of soon listening to the <unk> of his lover -- then they smell those behaviors.
He says, "Look, I know you think this is <unk> but it's not different than the interpretation of an old text or looking at a <unk>
He says, "These are scientific research, real value.
<unk> is trying to prove that the <unk> see <unk> and they make it seem like <unk> but in their <unk> they are search for knowledge, search for the truth, a really painful truth, in fact, to what to <unk> -- the more painful the truth, the better.
The pain, the <unk> -- these were the pathways for the wisdom of <unk>
He says, "A woman who we need, and that makes us suffer, causes us a much more profound feelings of feelings and vital and a wise man that can tell us.
It's telling us that we're going to look for women <unk>
No. I think it's trying to say that <unk> reveal ourselves.
And there's some other emotion that makes us <unk> in this particular way.
There's some other emotion to us, <unk> our <unk>
Any other emotion that teaches us to look at so <unk>
Freud would write about this later.
One day, Freud was visited by a very <unk> young man who was being used with the idea that his wife will <unk>
And Freud said that there was something bizarre in that man, who didn't stand on what his wife does.
And she was <unk> everybody knew it.
The poor creature was under suspicion without any cause.
But he was looking for things that he did his wife, without realizing <unk>
<unk> <unk> or just accidentally <unk> with a man?
Freud said that man was becoming the <unk> of the unconscious, of his wife.
<unk> are very good at this.
<unk> describe very well how the <unk> make us look at intensity but accurately.
In fact, the more intensely <unk> we are, more we become residents of fantasy.
And for this reason, I think, <unk> are taking us to do violent acts of violent or illegal acts.
<unk> are going to behave in fully <unk> ways.
Now I'm thinking about myself at eight years, but I'm also thinking about this story that I heard on the news.
A woman of Michigan was captured by 52 years old was captured by having created a false account at Facebook since they were sent messages very awful messages to itself, for a year.
For a year.
She was trying to <unk> the new girlfriend of his former former <unk> <unk> I have to confess that when or this, I reacted with awe.
Because, let's be realistic.
How huge if <unk> creativity. Right?
It's like novel.
Like a novel from Patricia <unk>
<unk> is one of my favorites.
She's a very bizarre character in the American literature.
It's the author of <unk> in a <unk> and <unk> Mr. <unk> books that try to do the <unk> <unk> of our minds, and once we are in the sphere, in the realm of the <unk> the membrane that separates what might be, can be <unk> in a second.
Take Tom <unk> his most famous character.
Tom <unk> goes from <unk> or want what you have to take away from your self and get rid of what you ever want, and it's under the floor -- <unk> to your name, it takes your <unk> cow your bank accounts.
It's a way.
But what do we do? We can't take the route from Tom <unk>
I can't give you all over the world, as much as sometimes I want.
It's a pity, because we live in times of envy.
We live in times of jealousy.
I mean, we're good citizens of social media, where the coin is the <unk> right?
<unk> show you <unk> I'm not safe.
So we're going to do what the characters always do when they're not sure, when they're at a mystery.
Let's go to <unk> Baker and ask by <unk> <unk>
When people think about <unk> think about <unk> <unk> in Professor <unk> that criminal genius.
But I've always got to have <unk> <unk> <unk> the head face of <unk> <unk> who needs to be <unk> <unk> needs the <unk> genius, but he cares about it.
Oh, it sounds so <unk>
<unk> needs their help, but <unk> and <unk> with <unk> in each of the puzzles.
But as they work together, something starts to change, and finally in "The <unk> of the Six <unk> once you <unk> you <unk> <unk> all with their solution, <unk> it goes back to <unk> and says, "We're not <unk> Mr. <unk>
We're proud of <unk>
And he tells you there's no person in <unk> <unk> who didn't want to leave your hand.
It's one of the few times that we see <unk> came in history. It looks very emotional. That scene is also mysterious, right?
It seems to treat the <unk> as a geometry of geometry, no emotion.
You know, in a minute <unk> is the opposite side of <unk>
And the next minute they are the same side.
All of a sudden, <unk> you can admire that idea of being his <unk>
Could it still be so simple?
What if <unk> are really a subject of geometry, just a question of where we allow us to be in relation to the other?
Well, maybe we don't have to get rid of the excellence of the other.
We can relate to it.
But I like <unk> plans.
So as we expect that to happen, let's remember that we have the fiction to <unk>
Just fiction <unk> jealousy.
<unk> used the <unk> invites them to the table.
And look at what <unk> <unk> the terrifying <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We're in excellent company.
Thank you.
We used to solve big problems.
The 21 of July July, 1969, Buzz Aldrin jumped outside the <unk> <unk> of the Apollo <unk> of the Apollo Sea, and it declined about the Sargasso Sea.
Armstrong and <unk> were alone, but his presence in the gray gray is the culmination of a collective collective process.
The Apollo program was the largest rise of peace in the U.S. history.
To get to the Moon, NASA spent about 180 billion dollars today, or four percent of the federal budget.
Apollo gave work to about 400,000 people and asked about 20,000 companies, universities and the government agencies.
They died people, including the crew of Apollo 1.
But before the Apollo program <unk> 24 men went to the moon.
<unk> <unk> on the surface, which I planned after death of Armstrong last year, is now the most <unk>
So, why do we <unk>
They didn't get a lot of <unk> <unk> pounds of old rocks, and something that the 24 <unk> later, a new sense of the <unk> and the fragility of our common home.
Why <unk> The cynical answer is that it was because President Kennedy wanted to prove to the <unk> that this nation had better rockets.
But the <unk> words at the University of Rice <unk> give us a better idea.
John F. Tell me about why <unk>
Why make it in our goal?
And you might ask, why can you climb the most <unk> mountain.
35 years ago, why fly over the <unk>
Why does Rice play <unk>
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon.
We chose to go to the moon in this decade, and do other things, not because they're simple, but because they're hard.
Jason <unk> For the dark, Apollo was not just a victory of the West about the Cold War.
At the time, the stronger emotion was the <unk> of <unk> to the power of the powers of technology.
They were because it was great to be able to do it.
The landing on the Moon occurred in a context of a long list of technology.
The first half of the 20th century produced the assembly line and the plane, penicillin and the vaccine for tuberculosis.
In the middle of the century, the <unk> <unk> and eliminated the smallpox.
Technology seemed to own what Alvin <unk> in 1970, called <unk> <unk>
For most of the history of humanity, we couldn't go faster than a horse, or a ship with candle -- but in 1969, the crew crew took 40,000 miles flew at 40,000 miles -- / hour.
Since 1970s, no human has gone back to the moon.
No one has traveled faster than the crew of Apollo 10, and the joyful optimism about the power of technology has evaporated to see that the problems that we imagine that technology would be going to go to Mars, create a clean energy, cure cancer, or feeding the world population, seem to have a result.
I remember the <unk> <unk> <unk>
I was five years old, and my mother told me that I didn't get to the <unk> tube tube <unk>
I really knew that this would be the last mission <unk> but I was completely sure that I would come to see the colonies on Mars.
So that would happen to our ability to solve problems with <unk> has become a common place.
We heard it all the time.
We've heard it for the last two days here, at TED.
It seems like the technologists were <unk> and they had been <unk> with trivial toys -- things like <unk> applications and social media, or algorithms that speed up.
There's nothing wrong in most of these things.
They have <unk> and <unk> our lives.
But not all the great problems of humanity.
What happened?
There's an <unk> explanation in Silicon Valley, which is that they've created a less ambitious companies that are created in the years that we have <unk> Microsoft, Apple and <unk>
Silicon Valley says that markets are the <unk> specifically the incentives that the venture capitalists offer entrepreneurs.
Silicon Valley says that the risk of risk caused the creation of <unk> ideas for the funding of <unk> or even false problems.
But I don't think this explanation is good enough.
<unk> mostly what's wrong in <unk> Valley.
Even when the venture capitalists were at their high point without worry about the risk, they preferred little investment, minute investments that they could leave in 10 years.
<unk> have always had trouble investing with benefit in technologies like energy, which need a huge capital and development is in the long term. It's also not invested in the development of technologies intended to solve big problems, because they don't have a commercial value.
No, the reasons why we can't solve the big problems are more complicated and profound.
Sometimes, we chose not to solve the big problems.
Could we go to Mars if we <unk>
NASA's has designed a plan.
But going to Mars would require a political decision that was popular and that will never happen.
We don't go to Mars because everybody thinks there are more important things to do on Earth.
Sometimes we can't solve the big problems, because political systems fail.
Today, less than two percent of the world's global energy consumption -- like solar energy and wind and <unk> Less than two percent, and the reason is completely cheap.
Carbon and natural gas is cheaper than solar and wind, and oil is cheaper than <unk>
We want to sources of alternative energy sources that they can compete with the price of price.
Now, technologists, entrepreneurs and economists agree about what policies and treated international treaties in an increase in an increase in research and development of energy, and some kind of price control of the coal.
But there is no hope in the political climate that we will see is that we will see an American energy policy or international treaties that reflect that consensus.
Sometimes, the great problems that seem technological, they are not to be.
We know for long time that famines are a result of failure to business <unk>
But 30 years of research have taught us that famines are political crisis that affect the distribution of food.
Technology can improve things like crops or systems for the storage and <unk> of food, but there will be famines while bad governments.
Finally, big problems sometimes <unk> a solution because we don't understand the problem.
The president pointed to the war to the war in 1971, but we soon found that there are many kinds of cancer, some terribly resistant to treatment, and only in the last 10 years, seem to have found effective and viable.
The hard problems are hard.
It's not true that we couldn't solve the problems with technology.
We can and we need -- but these four elements have to be <unk> The political leaders and the population must want to deal with the problem: the institutions must support the <unk> it must be really about a <unk> problem and we need to understand it.
The <unk> mission that has become something like a metaphor for the ability of technology to solve big problems, it is actually with those bill.
But it's a <unk> model in the future.
We're not in <unk>
There is no <unk> competition like in the Cold War, there is no politician like John Kennedy -- which is how hard and dangerous, and there is no popular mythology of science fiction as about exploring the solar system.
In general, go to the moon turned out to be simple.
I was just three days.
And really, I wasn't even <unk> any problem.
We're alone in our present, and the solutions of the future will be more difficult to get.
God knows that we don't have the challenges.
Thank you very much.
Well, I'm going to talk about trust, and I'm going to start to start with the <unk> ideas that have about confidence.
They're so common that they've become <unk> of our society.
I think it's three.
The first is a <unk> there have been a huge decline in trust, is a very general statement.
The second is a <unk> we should have more confident.
And the third one is a <unk> we should regain the confidence.
I think the <unk> the goal and the task have been <unk>
What I'm going to try and tell you today is a different story about a <unk> a goal and a task, which I think gives a more clear idea about it.
First of all, why do people think that trust has <unk>
And if I think about the base of my own <unk> I don't know the answer.
I bow to think that it may have gone down in some of the activities or institutions and that might have gone up in others.
I don't have it.
But I can turn to opinion polls and opinion polls are supposed to be the source of belief that the trust has decreased.
When you look at the surveys of opinion throughout time, there's no many evidence of it.
I mean, the people who are <unk> 20 years ago, mainly journalists and politicians, keep <unk> the same <unk>
And the people who were very trustworthy about 20 years ago, they still have a pretty good basis -- the hearing, the nurses.
The rest of us are in the middle, and, by the way, the average citizen of the street is almost exactly half the way.
But this is evidence enough?
What the surveys of opinion record are, of course, opinions.
What else can you do?
What you see is the generic attitudes that people are doing when people are doing some questions.
<unk> in <unk> <unk> in <unk>
Now, if somebody asked me, <unk> in the <unk>
<unk> in <unk>
<unk> in the <unk> teachers.
You would probably be able to ask, "What do you do?
And that would be a very scary answer.
And you might say, when you have answered your question, "Well, I trust some of them but in other no."
It's very rational.
Ultimately, in real life, we tend to place the confidence <unk>
We don't assume that the level of trust that we are going to feel for a certain kind of <unk> official or <unk> is going to be uniform in all cases.
I would, for example, say I trust a certain elementary school teacher that I know to give you the kind of reading, but in any way to drive the school <unk>
After all, I could know that it wasn't a good <unk>
I could trust my wildest friend to keep a conversation, but no, maybe, to keep a secret.
Simple.
And if we've got those evidence in our everyday lives in the way that the trust is <unk> why we actually leave all that knowledge when we think about trust in the more <unk>
I think the surveys are very bad tools to measure the real amount of real trust, because they are trying to <unk> the good judgment of trusting something or somebody.
Secondly, what about the goal?
The goal is to have more confident.
Frankly, I think it's a really stupid.
It's not that the goal that I <unk>
I'm going to have more confidence in what is <unk> of trust, but not what it is.
I'm <unk> I don't trust what it's not reliable.
And I think that those people who were paying their savings with very <unk> called Mr. <unk> who then disappeared with them, I think of them, and I think, well, they were too <unk>
Having more trust is not a smart goal in this life.
<unk> deposited or <unk> that is the right goal.
Once you tell it, he says, yeah, yeah, that means that what matters in the first place is not trust, but trustworthiness.
What is about doing a judgment of how trustworthy people are in certain ways.
And I think that we can make a trial, we're forced to focus on three things.
They're <unk> They're <unk> They're <unk>
And if we find that a person is competent in the <unk> commodities and it's responsible and honest, then we have a very good reason to trust it, because it's going to be worthy of confidence.
But if, on the contrary, they're not responsible -- we couldn't trust them.
I have friends who are competent and honest, but not <unk> in them to get a letter in the mail -- because they're <unk>
I have friends who are very sure that you can do certain things, but I see that you can see your own <unk>
And I'm glad to say that I don't have a lot of friends that are competent and responsible but extremely <unk>
If it's like that, I still haven't got any <unk>
But that's what we are <unk> to meet before confidence.
The trust is the answer.
<unk> is what we need to be <unk>
And of course, it's hard.
Over the last few decades, we've tried to build systems of accountability for all kinds of professional institutions, officials and so forth, that made us more easy to judge their trustworthiness.
Many of those systems have had the opposite effect.
They don't work like <unk>
I remember one time I was talking to a <unk> and he said, "Well, you know, the problem is that it takes more time to make the <unk> <unk> that will be going to be going to be able to make the pain <unk>
And we found the same problem in the whole of our public life, and we need the system of accountability that's meant to guarantee the <unk> and the evidence of <unk> actually is doing the opposite.
What they do is they <unk> the work of the people who have to do hard tasks like the <unk> <unk> that <unk> the <unk> as we say.
You may have all of you know similar examples.
It was all about it, for the target.
I think the goal should be more <unk> and that things would be different if they stop to be worthy of trust, and we gave them to the people that we are trustworthy and if we were able to figure out whether other people, officials or politicians are worthy of confidence.
It's not easy. It's the trial, the simple actions -- the <unk> that doesn't do properly.
Third, the task.
<unk> to the <unk> to rebuild the trust, puts things upside down.
It suggests that you and I should reconstruct the confidence.
Well, we can do it with ourselves.
We can reconstruct a little trustworthiness.
We can do it if they're two people, together, trying to improve the confidence.
But the trust, in the end, it is <unk> because they provide other people.
You can't reconstruct what other people have given you.
You have to give them the foundations for enough that you can trust you.
You have to be worthy of confidence.
And that, of course, is because you can't afford it, for general, to all people, all the time.
But you also have to give the evidence that you're worthy of confidence.
How do you do that?
That is a day, everywhere, it makes the common people, the <unk> the institutions, very effectively.
Let me give you a simple commercial example.
The store where I buy my socks back, says I can come back without giving up.
I carry it back and return the money, or you change it for the color I want.
That's great. I trust them because they became vulnerable to me.
I think there's a big lesson in that.
If you become vulnerable to the other hand, that's a very good proof that you're worthy of trust, and you have confidence in what you're saying.
So in the end, I think what we're pointing is not very difficult to <unk>
What people rely on is relationships, and in that framework, they can figure out when and how the other person is worthy of confidence.
Thank you.
From the beginning of computers we've been <unk> by reducing the separation between us and digital information, the separation between our material and the world of the screen that the imagination can be <unk>
This separation has gone <unk> more and more, to maybe more than one millimeter, the thickness of a <unk> screen, and the power power has become accessible to everyone.
But I ask myself, and if there was no <unk>
I started imagining what it would be.
I first created this tool that was made in the digital space, so that when the strong <unk> against the screen transfers their physical body to <unk>
Designers can <unk> their ideas directly in 3D, and surgeons can practice with virtual organs underneath the screen.
So with this tool <unk>
But the two hands remain still outside the screen.
How do you get inside and interact with digital information using all the dexterity of your hands?
In the Science <unk> <unk> <unk> along with my mentor <unk> <unk> <unk> the computer and transformed a little space on the keyboard into a digital area of work.
It <unk> a transparent bombsight with cameras deep to detect the fingers and the face, you can now lift the hands of the keyboard, will get into the inside of the 3D space, and grab pixels directly with your hands.
Like the windows and archives have a location in real space, <unk> is as easy as taking a book from a <unk>
You can put it through the book and highlight <unk> or words with the virtual <unk> which is on the bottom of every single <unk>
The architects can stretch or rotate their models directly with hands.
In these examples, we are moving in the digital world.
And if we invest the papers and we make the digital information come into us?
And so many of us will have bought and returned to the Internet.
Now that doesn't have to worry about.
What I have here is a virtual <unk> on the Internet.
This is the vision that you get from a device on the head or <unk> when the system is understanding the geometry of your body.
If we took this idea further, I thought instead of just seeing pixels in space, how can we make physical beings so that we can <unk> and <unk>
How would a future like this?
At the MIT Media Lab, with my tutor Hiroshi Hiroshi <unk> and my collaborator <unk> Post, we created this only physical therapies.
This dramatic magnet is behaving like a 3D pixel in space, which means that both the computer as users can move the object anywhere inside this little three-dimensional space.
<unk> what we did was <unk> gravity and control the movement through a combination of different levitation and <unk> and mechanical <unk>
And when we program digitally released the object, we release it from the constraints of time and space, which means that human movements can <unk> and go back to reproduce and stay in the physical world.
You can teach them physically and distance and distance and the famous shot of Michael Jordan you can reproduce it as a physical reality that we want.
The students can use it as a tool to understand complicated concepts like the movement of planets, physics, and unlike <unk> or textbooks -- this is a real and palpable experience that you can play and feel.
But what is most fascinating to change the computer physics is to imagine how to program the world is going to change our everyday physical activities.
As you can see, digital information is not just going to show something but to start to act directly on us as part of the physical world around us, without us that we have to <unk> out of our world.
So we started the talk today talking about a barrier, but if you will, that barrier, the only limit that is our imagination.
Thank you.
I was <unk> to become <unk> for two years in <unk> China, in the 1960s.
When I was in first grade, the government wanted to take a school for athletes to athletes all the <unk>
But my tiger mother said, "No."
My parents wanted me to become engineering.
After surviving the Cultural Revolution, they believed firmly that there was only a broken way to the <unk> a safe job and <unk>
No matter if the work would like me or not.
But my dream was to be a Chinese opera <unk>
This was me, in my imaginary piano.
A opera singer must begin to <unk> from very young to learn the <unk> so I tried everything I could to go to the opera school.
I even wrote to the director of the school and the host of a radio program.
But no adult would get the idea.
No adult took me seriously.
My friends, I was like, but they were kids, without authority, like me.
So at the age of 15 years, I knew it was already too much more to train.
My dream is never <unk>
<unk> that for the rest of my life a second class happiness was the only thing I could aspire to.
And this was so unfair.
So I decided to find another <unk>
No one of them wanted to <unk> Okay.
Tell the books.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> from the <unk> of <unk> <unk> I came to the United States in 1995, and what were the first books that were here?
Those who were <unk> in China, of course.
Good <unk> it's about Chinese <unk>
And it's not propaganda <unk>
The Bible is interesting, but strange.
That's a subject for another day.
But the fifth commandment for me was a <unk> <unk> to your father and your mother."
<unk> I said, "It's so different, and much better than <unk>
So it became my tool to come out of this <unk> <unk> and to reset the relationship with my parents.
I meet a new culture as a new culture of reading <unk>
We have a lot of perspectives.
For example, the beginning of this map seemed to me out of place because this is what the students in China learn.
I had never occurred to me that China didn't have to be in the center of the world.
A map involves the perspective of people.
The comparative reading is not something new.
It's a common practice in the academic world.
There are to the research fields like comparative and comparative literature and literature.
<unk> and <unk> offers the academics a deeper understanding of a subject.
And I thought that if I read comparative reading it worked for research, why not do it as well as a day in the day.
So I started reading books from two.
They can be <unk> <unk> of Walter <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who were involved in a very <unk> or friends with <unk> experiences.
For the <unk> the <unk> are economic and spiritual <unk>
For Buddha, they're all <unk> lust, fear and <unk> Interesting.
If you know another language, it's fun to read your favorite books in two languages.
<unk> path to <unk> <unk> Thomas <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> rather than lost in the translation, I found that you can win a lot of it.
For example, it's through the translation that I realized that <unk> Chinese literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
And <unk> in Chinese, it literally means <unk> <unk> <unk>
The books opened up a magic door to connect with people from the past and the present.
I know I'm not going to go back to feeling used or powerless
Having a <unk> dream is really not compared to what many other people have <unk>
I've come to believe that I'm not the only purpose of a dream.
Their most important purpose is to connect with the place that the dreams come from, where the passion, where happiness comes from.
Until a broken dream can do that for you.
And it's because of the books, that I'm here, happy -- living again with purpose and clarity, most of the time.
So the books always have the <unk>
Thank you.
Thank you.  Thank you.
When I was in my <unk> I saw my first customer <unk>
I was a Ph.D. student in psychology at Berkeley clinic.
She was a woman from 26 years called Alex.
Alex went into the first session of using jeans and a <unk> <unk> went on the couch of my office and he had taken the shoes and told me that I wanted to talk about their problems with men.
When I heard this, I felt so <unk>
My roommate had a <unk> as a first client.
And I had a <unk> who wanted to talk about men.
I thought I could handle it.
But I didn't.
With the <unk> stories that Alex brought to the sessions, it made me easy just to move the head while he <unk> the solution.
"The <unk> are the new <unk> he said Alex, and so I was right.
You start to work after that, you get home after that, you have kids later, to death later.
For the <unk> like Alex and I had time to cut off.
But shortly after, my <unk> drove me to press Alex who would talk about his life <unk>
I was <unk>
I said, "Sure, coming out with the guys underneath his category, <unk> with a <unk> head, but it's not like it was to marry him."
And then my <unk> said, "No no, but maybe it was <unk> with the next.
In addition, the best time to work on marriage of Alex is before it was <unk>
This is what psychologists call a <unk> moment.
It was when I realized that the <unk> are not the new <unk>
Yes, people feel head after what they had, but it didn't make the <unk> of Alex were a pause in their development.
This made the <unk> of Alex was the perfect time and we were <unk>
And so I realized, this kind of <unk> <unk> was a real problem and had real unintended consequences, not only for Alex and his loving life, but for the careers and the future families and the future <unk>
There are 50 million <unk> in the United States, today.
This means 15 percent of the population, or 100 percent if you think nobody comes to adulthood without going through the <unk>
Hands up if they're in your <unk>
I want to see the <unk> here.
Oh, yeah. They're amazing.
If you work with <unk> they love a <unk> you take the dream of a <unk> I want to see -- it's okay. He doesn't really matter.
This is not just my view. These are the facts.
We know that 80 percent of the key moments in life will happen at 35 years.
So this means that eight of the 10 decisions and experiences and moments that give you a way to your life -- you might have spent 30 and <unk>
<unk> <unk> <unk>
This audience is going to be good, I think.
We know that the first 10 years of a career have an exponential impact on the amount of money that we get.
We know that more than half of Americans are married, or they're coming out with their future mate at 30 years.
We know that the brain ends up their second and final phase of growth in their <unk> and they are <unk> for <unk> what it means if there is something you want to change themselves, now is the moment to change it.
We know that personality. It changes more times during their <unk> than at any other time in life, and we know that the female fertility gets to the top of the 28, and things become complicated to the <unk>
<unk> are the moment to get them over their body and their options.
When we think about the development of the child, we all know that the first five years are crucial for language and attachment in the brain.
It's a moment in which their everyday and common life has an impact on the person who was <unk>
But what we don't hear with often is that there's something called adult development and our <unk> are a critical moment in adult development.
But this is not what the ones are listening.
The newspapers talk about changes in the line of time <unk>
The researchers call the <unk> a extended adolescence <unk>
<unk> <unk> names <unk> like <unk> and <unk>
It's true.
As a culture, we've considered a <unk> which is actually the decade that defines the <unk>
Leonard Cohen said that to make great things, you need a plan and not enough time.
Isn't it?
What do you think happens when you give a <unk> on your head and you say, you have another 10 years to start your <unk>
There's nothing.
They stole that person the sense of urgency and his ambition and it doesn't happen absolutely nothing.
And then every day, smart, interesting ones like you or your children get to my office and say something like this: "I know my boyfriend is good for me, but this relationship doesn't notice, I'm just killing time."
Or they say, "Everybody says that as I start a career before the 30, everything will be okay."
But then it starts to sound like this: "My <unk> are for <unk> and I still have nothing to show you.
I had better mistake the day I graduated from the <unk>
And then it starts to sound like this: "My dates for the <unk> were like the chairs.
They were all running and <unk> but then at some point about 30, it turned the music and all started to sit down.
I didn't want to be the only thing to stand standing, so sometimes I think I married my husband because he was the closest chair when he had <unk>
Where are the ones here?
They don't do that.
Well, that sounds like a little bit of it, but it's not <unk> the stakes are very high.
When you leave a lot of things for the <unk> there's a huge amount of pressure to the 30 and so many of you start a career, to pick a spouse, and have two or three children in a long period of time.
And so many of these things are not <unk> and there's research that starts to show, which is much harder and stressful to do everything in the <unk>
The middle-aged crisis is not about buying red sports cars.
It's about realizing you can't have the race you want now.
You realize you can't have the child you want now, or you can't give you a brother to your son.
A lot of <unk> and <unk> you look at themselves, and to me, sitting in the room, and they talk about his <unk> "What was you doing? What was you thinking?"
I want to change what the ones are doing and thinking.
Here is a story of what it might be.
It's a story about a woman called <unk>
At 25, Emma came to my office because I was in his own words, having a identity crisis.
He said that he would like to work in art or entertainment, but you couldn't even decide, so I spent the last few years working as <unk>
As it was cheaper, I lived with a boyfriend, who showed more <unk> than ambition.
And even though we live a few very hard -- the previous life had been even more difficult.
<unk> often in our sessions, but then he got up to say, "You don't pick your family, but you can pick your friends."
Well, one day he got his head on his head and cried for almost every hour.
I was just buying a new book for <unk> and he had spent the whole morning -- I had a lot of friends, but then he was watching the empty space that follows after the words in the case of emergency words, please call <unk>
I was about the <unk> when he saw me and said, "Who is going to be for me if I have an accident.
Who is going to take care of if you give me <unk>
At that time, it took me a lot of work to resist and I don't say, <unk>
What Emma needed to do was not a <unk> that was really <unk>
Emma needed a better life, and I knew this was his opportunity.
I had learned a lot since I worked with Alex as to just sit at just sitting next to me.
So, for the next weeks and months, I said to Emma three things that all <unk> man or woman, deserves to know.
First of all, I said to Emma who was <unk> of that identity crisis and <unk> of identity.
For identity, I mean doing something that add value to your person.
Doing something that is an investment in what you want to be after.
I didn't know the future of <unk> and nobody knows the future of work, but I know this: identity capital generates identity capital.
So now it's the time for that work on the other side of the country, from that company that you want to try it.
I'm not <unk> exploration, I'm <unk> the exploration that should not tell you, which, by the way, is not <unk>
It's <unk>
I said to Emma who would explore jobs and to tell.
Second, I told Emma that urban tribes are <unk>
The best friends are great to take you to the airport, but the ones that come together with friends with similar minds are limited to who you know what you know, how you think about it, and where they work.
That new piece of capital, that new person who comes out almost always comes out of their closest <unk>
The new things come from what they're called weak bonds of friends of friends.
Yes, half of the <unk> have a bad job or don't have work.
But the other half no, and the weak bonds are the form of <unk> to this group.
The half of the <unk> jobs are never <unk> then knowing the head of your neighbor is the way you get a job not published yet.
It's not cheating. It's the science of how information happens.
For the last but not least, Emma believed that you don't pick your family, but I know his friends.
This was true when I was growing up, but as <unk> Emma will soon get to his family when I have a partner and we form her own family.
I said to Emma that time to pick his family had come.
Maybe you think the 30 is a better age to sit down, and the 20 or even 25 and the 25 and I agree with you.
But choosing the person that you live now or <unk> now when everyone on Facebook, they start walking towards <unk> is not progress.
The best time to work in your marriage is before you have it, and that means to be so intentional in love as you are at work.
<unk> your family must be a conscious choice of who and what they want instead of just doing it is going to work or kill time with anyone who owns you.
So what happened to <unk>
Well, we looked at that <unk> and she found the <unk> <unk> who worked in an art museum in another state.
This weak bond was helped to get a job there.
That labor supply gave him a reason to leave the boyfriend, with the <unk>
Now, five years later, it's <unk> special events in museums.
This married a man who chose <unk>
<unk> his new career, loves her new family, and I send a letter to me that said, "Now the spaces of emergency contacts are not <unk>
The story of Emma may sound easy, but that's what I love to work with <unk>
It's very easy to help them.
<unk> are like planes coming out of the Los Angeles airport coming out somewhere in the West.
Just before the <unk> a light fits in its trajectory makes the difference between land in Alaska or <unk>
In the same way, at the same way, at the age of 21 or the <unk> a good conversation, a good deal of TED may have massive effects in the next years or even in the next generations.
Here's my idea worth of spreading all the ones that know.
It's as simple as what I learned to tell Alex.
It's what I now have the privilege to say to <unk> like all the <unk> <unk> are not the new <unk> <unk> their <unk> get identity, use your <unk> <unk> pick up your family.
They didn't stop what they didn't know or what they didn't know.
Are they deciding their life today.
Thank you.
When I was 27 years old, I left a very <unk> job at a job that was even more <unk> the <unk>
I went to teach them mathematics to students from seventh degree in New York City.
And like any teacher, we have tests and tests.
Let me give you tasks.
When I work back, <unk> grades.
What struck me was that I.Q. was not the only difference between my best and older students.
Some of the ones that had a better performance didn't have any <unk> I.Q.
Some of my smartest children were not going so well.
And that got me thinking.
The kind of things that you need to learn in mathematics in seventh grade, sure, they're <unk> <unk> <unk> the area of a <unk>
But these concepts are not impossible and I was very convinced that each of my students could learn the lesson if they worked hard and during time enough.
After several years more than <unk> I came to the conclusion that what we need in education is a better understanding of students and learning from a <unk> perspective from a psychological perspective.
In education, the only thing we know how to measure a better way.
It's the <unk> but what happens if you succeed in school and life depends on much more than the ability to learn how to be fast and easy?
So I left the classrooms, and I went to college to become <unk>
I started studying kids and adults in all sorts of <unk> <unk> and every study my question was, who has success here and why?
My research team and I went to the <unk> West <unk>
And we tried to predict what to do -- we have the military training and who are <unk>
We went to the National <unk> of <unk> and we tried to predict what children are going to do the most possible in competition.
We studied college professors working in really difficult neighborhoods, and <unk> what teachers are still teaching for the end of the year and <unk> who will be the most effective in improving the outcomes of their <unk>
We teamed up with private companies, asking you, what of these vendors are going to keep their job <unk>
And who is going to make more money?
In all those contexts, we came up with a feature as an important <unk> of success.
And it wasn't social intelligence.
It wasn't the good look, the physical health and not the I.Q.
It was <unk>
<unk> is passion and perseverance to achieve long-term goals.
<unk> is to have a resistance.
<unk> is clinging to your future, day after day, not only for the week, not only the month, but for years and working really hard to make that future a reality.
<unk> is to live the life as if it was a <unk> not a public <unk>
A few years ago, I started studying the determination in the public schools of Chicago.
I asked thousands of high school students that did all my questionnaires of determination and then waited about more than a year to see who <unk>
It turns out that children with more determination they had significantly more likely to cheat even when the <unk> in every trait that I could measure, things like family income, the results of the testing tests even the security that they felt when they were in school.
So it's not only in West Point or in the National <unk> of <unk> where <unk> is in school, especially for kids at risk of <unk>
To me, the most shocking thing about determination is the little thing that we know, how little it knows the science of the development.
Every day, parents and teachers ask me, "How do you change your <unk>
What do I have to do to teach kids a real ethics ethic.
How keep them going to keep the <unk>
The most honest answer is: I don't know.  What I know is that talent doesn't give you <unk>
Our data shows very clearly that there are lots of talented individuals that are simply not following their <unk>
In fact, in our data, determination is commonly related to or is even related to how we talented talent.
So far, the best idea I've heard about developing the determination is something called <unk> <unk>
This is an idea developed at Stanford University, by Carol <unk> and it's the belief that the ability to learn is not fixed, that it can change the effort.
Dr. <unk> has shown that when the kids read and learn about the brain and how it changes and grows in response to the challenge, they are much more prone to <unk> when they <unk> because they don't believe that failure is a permanent condition.
So the growth mindset is a great idea to develop <unk>
But we need more.
And that's where my speech, because that's where we are.
That's the work that we have on the front.
We need to take our best ideas, our stronger intuitions and we need to <unk>
We need to measure if they've been successful and we need to be willing to fail, and we would start to start all the new things with the lessons <unk>
In other words, we need to be determined about making our children more <unk>
Thank you.
<unk> in Taiwan as the daughter of a <unk> one of my <unk> memories is my mother <unk> the beauty, the beauty and the shape of the Chinese characters.
Since that time, I was fascinated by this incredible language.
But for a foreigner. It seems to be as <unk> as the Great Wall China.
Over the last few years, I've been asking myself if I can break down this <unk> so that whoever you want to understand and appreciating the beauty of this sophisticated language can do it.
I started thinking about how a new method and fast learning would be useful.
Since I was five years old, I started learning how to draw each of the strokes of every character in the right sequence.
I learned new characters every day for the next 15 years.
Because we only have five minutes, it's better than do it in a faster and simple way.
A Chinese academic <unk> 20,000 characters.
You just need a thousand to understand basic <unk>
The first 200 will allow us to understand 40 percent of basic literature, enough enough to read signs of traffic <unk> <unk> to understand the basic idea of the Web pages or newspapers.
Today I will start with eight to show you how the method works.
Are you ready?
You open your mouth as much as possible.
They get a mouth.
This is a person who's going to give a ride.
<unk>
If the shape of the fire is a person with arms on both sides, as if I was shouting <unk> I am <unk> this symbol is actually <unk> in the form of the called, but I like to believe that it's the other way.
This is a tree.
tree.
This is a mountain.
The sun.
The moon.
The <unk> symbol looks like a couple of <unk> gates in the old West <unk>
I call these eight characters.
They are building blocks for a lot more characters.
One person.
If someone walks back, that's <unk>
As the old said, two are a company, three are crowd.
If one person stretches your arms, this person is saying <unk> that big.
The person inside the mouth, the person is <unk>
It's a chimpanzee as a <unk> inside the whale.
A tree is a tree. Two trees together, we have a forest.
Three trees together, we have the forest.
Put a table under the tree, we have the foundation.
Put a mouth on the tree, that's a <unk>  <unk> to remember, because a tree speaker, it's quite an idiot.
Remember <unk>
Two fireworks together, it gets very hot.
Three fireworks together, that's a lot of flames.
Put the fire under the two trees, that's <unk>
For us, the sun is the source of prosperity.
Two <unk> together, <unk>
Three together, those are <unk>
Put the sun and the moon together, that's the <unk>
It also means tomorrow, after one day and a night.
The sun comes out on the horizon.
One door. Get a table inside the door, it's the <unk> of the door.
Put a mouth inside the door, asking questions.
<unk> played with someone at home?
This person is going out hidden from a door, <unk> <unk>
On the left, we have a woman.
Two women together, are <unk>
Three women together, are <unk>
So we've already gone for almost 30 characters.
By using this method, the first eight radical -- will allow them to build 32.
The next group of eight characters will build other 32.
So with each little effort, you will be able to learn a couple hundred characters, which is the same thing that learns a Chinese <unk>
So after knowing the characters, we started making sentences.
For example, the mountain and the fire together, we have a mountain of fire. It's a <unk>
We know that Japan is the land of the <unk>
This is a sun placed with the <unk> because Japan is in the east of China.
So a sun next to origin, we created Japan.
One person behind Japan, what do we have?
A Japanese person.
The character on the left are two mountains stacked over the other.
In ancient China, that meant in exile, because the Chinese <unk> <unk> their political enemies beyond the mountains.
Today, the exile has become a <unk>
A mouth that tells you where to go out is a <unk>
This is a slide to remind me that I must stop talking and go down the stage. Thank you.
What I prefer to be Dad are the movies that I get to see.
I love to share my favorite films with my <unk> when my daughter was four years old, we saw the magician in Oz together.
And the movie was his imagination for months.
His favorite character was <unk> of course.
He gave a good excuse to use a bright dress and bring a magic wand
But when you see that movie so many times, you get to understand that it's extraordinary.
We now live and we raised our children in a sort of an industrial complex of child's fantasy show.
But the magician in Oz was an event in itself.
It didn't start that trend.
The trend really took 40 years later with, interestingly, but another movie whose <unk> a metal guy and a guy named <unk> <unk> a girl dressed as an enemy.
Do you know what I'm talking about?
There's a huge difference between these two films, there are a couple of big differences between the magician in the magician and all the movies that we see today.
One is that there are very little violence in the magician <unk>
The monkeys are pretty aggressive, like <unk>
But I think if the magician magician is done today, the magician would say, <unk> you're the salvation of Oz like the prophecy.
You use magic shoes to defeat the <unk> the <unk> computer generated by the computer of the <unk> <unk>
But that's not what happens.
Another unique thing about the magician in Oz is that the most thoughtful characters and even <unk> are women.
I started noticing this when I did to watch Star Wars for years later, and the situation was different.
At that time, he had a child as well.
First years old.
It wasn't invited to the projection because it was still very small for that.
But it was the second son, and the <unk> level had been <unk>  And so slid it in the room and was struck as a foot in the room with his <unk> behind, and I don't think he understood what was going on, but <unk> <unk> everything.
I wonder what to do.
Would you be <unk> <unk> <unk>
It would have the feeling that Luke is one to an army to remove the government?
<unk> this with <unk> <unk>
How do you have Dorothy his movie?
They do good <unk> with all and being a <unk>
It's the kind of world that I want my children to grow up with you, OK? And not a world of men who are <unk> which is where we are.
Why is there so much competitive capital force in the movies for our children, and so little on the way of brick <unk>
There's a lot of literature on the impact of male violence on the girls, and they should be <unk> It's very good.
I haven't read so much about how kids react to this encouragement.
I know the experience that Princess <unk> doesn't give me the right framework that would have served me to navigate through the world of adults who is <unk>  I think at the time of the first <unk> I really expected the students to appear because it's the end of the film, right?
My search is finished, I have a <unk>
Why are you standing there?
I don't know what I should do.
The movies focused on defeat <unk> and get their reward, and they don't leave time for other relationships or other <unk>
It's almost like a child, you have to be a dumb animal, and if you're a girl, you have to use a <unk> suit.
There are a lot of exceptions, and to defend the Disney princess before any of you.
But they send a message to the children, even though they guys, they are not really their goal.
They do a phenomenal job when teaching girls how to defend themselves against <unk> but they don't necessarily show kids how to defend the <unk>
There's no model for them.
We also have some great women who write new stories for our children, as real and lovely as <unk> and <unk> but they don't stop being movies of war.
Of course, the most successful theme of all times is still appearing on classic <unk> on the classic <unk> of a child or a man, or two men who are friends, or a man and his son, or two men who raised a little girl.
Until many of you are thinking, this year, it finally came out <unk>
I recommend all of you. It's already available in stores.
Remember what the critical <unk> said when it came out of <unk>
I can't believe that Pixar is made a movie of a <unk>
It's very good. Don't let it be <unk>
Well, almost none of these movies is the test of <unk>
I don't know if you've heard about this.
It's still not the root of the root and it's already <unk> but maybe we're going to start a movement.
<unk> <unk> is a comic book <unk> and in the <unk> I recorded a conversation I had with a friend on the assessment of the movies that you saw.
And it's very simple. There are only three questions you have to be <unk> in the movie, there's more of a female character that has lines?
So, you have to fulfill the <unk>
These women talk about each other at some point in the movie?
Their conversations are about something else than the guy that you like it?  Right? Thank you.  Thank you.
Two women who exist and talk about things each other.
<unk> I've seen, and yet very rarely I see it in the cinema that we know and love.
In fact, this week I went to see a very good <unk> film.
Right? <unk> of <unk> success -- an idea of consensus that is a Hollywood Hollywood movie.
<unk> doesn't happen the <unk> test.
And I don't think that <unk> because a lot of the film, I don't know if you've seen it, a lot of the movie happens in a embassy where men and women are hiding during the crisis in the hostage.
We have a lot of scenes of men who have deep and painful conversations in this <unk> and it's the great time for one of the actors to get a look at the door and say, "Let's go back to bed, <unk>
This is Hollywood.
So let's go back in the numbers.
In 2011, of the 100 percent popular movies, how many of them believe they have protagonists of <unk>
<unk> Not bad.
It's not the same percentage that the number of women that we've chosen recently for Congress, then it's okay.
But there is a bigger number than this one who is going to be <unk> this room.
Last year, The New York Times ran a study that the government had done.
This is what he said, "That's it.
One in the United States, one in five women said that it's been sexually sexually <unk>
I don't think it's the fault.
I don't think the movies for children have something to do with that.
I don't believe that the music videos or pornography are closely <unk> but something goes wrong, and when I hear that statistic one of the things I think is that there is a great amount of sexual <unk>
Who are those <unk> What are those <unk>
What do they do <unk>
They're <unk> the story says that the role of a male hero is to defeat the <unk> with violence, and then you get the reward, which is a woman who has no friends and not <unk>
We are <unk> that story?
You know, as a father with the privilege of raising a daughter like those of you who are doing the same thing, we found this world and this statistical statistic and we want to <unk>
We have tools to our disposal as <unk> <unk> and we hope that <unk> but I have to ask, <unk> <unk> is going to <unk> if at the same time, active or <unk> are educating our children to keep their power <unk>
I mean, I think the list list is a way to do something really important, and here I mean mainly parents.
I think we have to show our male children a new definition of <unk>
<unk> definition is radically changing.
You've read about how the new economy is changing the role of the home and the <unk>
It's all changing.
When I asked my daughter what his favorite character for Star Wars Do you know what they <unk>
<unk>
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
What do you have in common these two?
Maybe it's not just the bright dress.
I think they're experts.
I think these are the two people in those movies that you know more than anyone, and they love to share their knowledge with other people to help us achieve their potential.
They are leaders.
I like that kind of stories for my daughter, and I like that kind of stories for my son.
I want more stories like that.
I want less stories in which to tell my <unk> go and fight only and more stories where you see that his work is to join a team, maybe a team led by women, helping other people improve and better people, like the magician <unk>
Thank you.
As a little girl, I was living in Maine and one of the things that I liked the most was looking at the sea cookies, because my parents told me that I would give me luck.
But you know, it's hard to find these <unk>
There are sand covered and it's hard to see them.
And yet, over time, I was fascinated by <unk>
I started looking at shapes and patterns that helped me <unk>
This became a passion for finding things, in love for the past and <unk>
And finally when I started studying <unk> I realized that I saw my own eyes wasn't enough.
Because, suddenly, in Egypt, my little beach in Maine had grown up with almost 1.3 miles of length with the <unk>
And my sea cart had grown to the size of cities.
This is really what led me to use satellite imagery.
To try to make a map of the past, I knew I had to do it differently.
I want to show you an example of how different we see the infrared <unk>
This is a place sitting in the East Coast of Egypt called <unk>
And the place in the naked eye, it seems to be brown, but when we use the infrared and process it using <unk> <unk> suddenly the place looks like pink <unk>
What you're seeing is the real chemical changes in the landscape by the construction materials and the activities of the ancient Egyptian.
I want to share with you how we used the satellite data to find a <unk> city, called <unk> lost for thousands of years.
<unk> was the oldest capital of Egypt for over 400 years in a period of time called the Middle Empire about 4,000 years ago.
The place lies in the <unk> Egypt, and it's really important because in the Middle Empire -- there was this great renaissance of the old art <unk> architecture and religion.
<unk> have always known that <unk> was located somewhere near the pyramids of the two kings that the <unk> <unk> within the red circles, but somewhere inside this enormous <unk>
This area is enormous -- it's about <unk> by <unk>
Before, the Nile <unk> right next to the <unk> and as it changed over time, he moved on to this and covered the entire city.
So how do you find a <unk> city in a <unk>
And I'm going to try and find out the equivalent of looking for a needle in a <unk> with the eyes and using baseball <unk>
So we use NASA data to make a map of the place, with very subtle changes.
So we were able to see where the <unk> is.
But you can see more <unk> and it's even more interesting, this area slightly elevated that you see within the circle here, which we thought could be the location of <unk>
So we collaborated with Egyptians by Egyptians doing <unk> jobs can see here.
When I say <unk> it's like the shots of it on ice, but instead of layers of climate change, we look for layers of human occupation here.
Five meters down, underneath a thick thick layer of mud, we found a dense layer of <unk> objects.
This means that in this possible location of <unk> five meters down, we have a layer of occupation of a number of hundreds of years that date from the Ottoman Empire exactly the same period that we think is <unk>
We also found jobs of <unk> <unk> quartz and <unk> what proves that there was a <unk> shop.
This might seem like it's not too much, but when we think about the most common stones used in the jewelry of the Middle Empire -- these are the stones that are <unk>
So we have a dense layer of occupation that back the Middle Empire back in this place.
We also have evidence of a elite array shop that shows that what has been there, was a very important city.
We still don't see <unk> here, but <unk> the place in a near future.
And most importantly, we have the resources to train young Egyptians in the use of satellite technology so that they can also perform great discoveries.
I want to finish with my favorite quote from the Roman Empire -- it was probably written in <unk> 4,000 years ago.
Let me share knowledge is the most <unk>
There's nothing like that on the ground.
So as I think, TED was not founded in 1984 and <unk>
Do the ideas really happen in 1984 BC.
It certainly puts the pursuit of marine shells.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
I want to invite you to close your eyes.
You know, standing outside the door of <unk> house.
I'd like you to pay attention to the color of the door, to the material that it's made.
Now let's go through a group of <unk> obese people.
They are competing in a bicycle <unk> race and they go in the direction of their <unk>
I need to see this <unk>
They're <unk> strong, they're <unk> they're <unk>
And they collide against the door of your house.
There are bicycles flying everywhere, wheels that go on their side, lightning on the wheels that end up in <unk> places -- the threshold line.
And the lobby, to the hall, or what there is the other side of the door, and watch the quality of the light is shining on the <unk> of <unk>
<unk> with hand <unk>
From his chair on a brown horse.
It's a horse that you talk about.
You can feel your blue <unk> it's going to tickle your nose.
You can smell the <unk> cookie and you get to get on my mouth.
They slept on the side and they trained their living room.
In the room, and making use of their imagination, just imagine Britney <unk>
It's with little clothes, dancing on your center <unk> singing to <unk> One More <unk>
Now let's go through the kitchen.
The ground has been coated with a <unk> way from the oven coming to you <unk> the Man of <unk> the <unk> and the Len of "The <unk> of <unk> <unk> of the hands, jumping up to you.
Okay. Open your eyes.
I want to tell you about a particular contest that is done every spring in New York City.
It's called the <unk> of the United States."
I went to cover this event a few years ago as a <unk> waiting journalist, I guess, this was like the end of a <unk> <unk>
There were several men and a few different ages, different ages of hygiene.
They were <unk> hundreds of numbers -- they look at them once.
It was <unk> the names of tens and tens of strangers.
We took whole poems in just minutes.
<unk> to see who could actually memorize the order of a deck of <unk>
And I was thinking, "This is <unk>
These people must be <unk>
And I started talking to some of the competitors.
This is a man called Ed Cook who had come from England and have one of the best <unk>
I asked her, "Do you know when you realize you were a <unk>
Ed replied, I'm not a wise.
Actually, I have an average memory.
Everybody who engage from this competition they say they have normal memory.
We said, "We have trained to perform these miraculous acts of memory using a few thousand years ago -- invented 2,500 years ago in Greece, the same techniques that used to memorize their <unk> and the medieval <unk> were used to memorize children's books.
And my reaction was, "Well, how did you not hear about this <unk>
We were standing outside the room of competition, and <unk> who is a wonderful English <unk> but a little bit of <unk> he said, <unk> you are an American journalist.
You know Britney <unk>
And I said, "What? No, why?
Because I would like to teach Britney <unk> how do they memorize the order on a deck of <unk> living in national TV.
That would tell the world that anybody can do it."
And I said, "Well, I'm not going to be Britney <unk> but maybe you can teach me to me.
I mean, you have to start by something right?"
And that was the beginning of a very strange trip to me.
I ended up most of the year -- not just training my memory but also <unk> trying to understand how it works, why sometimes it doesn't work, and what their potential.
I met a lot of really interesting people.
This is a man called <unk>
He's <unk> very probably with the worst memory in the world.
His memory was so bad that I didn't even remember that he had a problem of <unk> it's awesome.
Somebody incredibly tragic, but it was a window that allowed to see how far our memory does that we are.
On the other end of the spectrum I met this man.
This is Kim <unk> In he was based on the role of <unk> <unk> in the movie.
We spent a afternoon in the public library in Salt Lake City, <unk> <unk> <unk>
And to come back, a number of treaties on the memory written something over 2,000 years ago in Latin, in <unk> and then in the Middle Ages.
And I learned a lot of really interesting things.
One of the most interesting things I learned is that there was a time when this idea of having a disciplined and disciplined thing was not a thing as rare as it can look like today.
A long time ago, people to invest in their memory, to provide their minds.
These techniques have made possible our modern world, but they have changed.
They have been culturally changed, and I would argue that they've changed cognitive beings.
Because we have almost no need to remember, sometimes we have forgotten how to do it.
One of the last places on our planet where people are still passionate about this idea of a disciplined and disciplined memory is this current competition of memory.
It's actually not very <unk> there is this whole thing around the world.
I was <unk> I wanted to know how these people do.
A few years ago, a group of researchers from University College in London invited a group of memory champions to the lab.
They wanted to know: Is it having brains in some ways, structural or <unk> different from the rest of us?
The answer was, no.
They're just more intelligent than <unk>
They gave them a battery of cognitive tests, and the answer was actually not.
There was a really interesting difference and significant difference between the brains of memory champions and the subjects of control with the <unk>
When they put them into an MRI MRI machine, you have the brain as they <unk> numbers, faces and forms of the snow. They found that on the memory champion of the brain, different parts of the brain.
They were actually <unk> or they looked like a part of the brain that involves space and navigation.
Why? There's something we can learn from this?
The tournament of <unk> <unk> is driven as a armed race where each year there is someone with a new way of remembering more things, more quickly, and then the rest of the competitors must get to the day.
This is my friend Ben <unk> three times <unk>
On his desk, in front of him, there are 36 <unk> of <unk> <unk> which he's about trying to memorize in an hour, using a technique that he invented and that he was only <unk>
He used a very similar technique to memorize the precise order of <unk> digits <unk>
<unk> Yes.
And as there is a great amount of ways to remember things in these competence, absolutely all the techniques used at the end of the end to a single concept that psychologists call <unk> <unk>
It is illustrates with a elegant paradox known as the <unk> <unk> <unk> says the following: I tell two people who remember the same word -- I say the same word -- you know, you have a man called <unk>
That's his <unk>
And then I ask you, "Do you have a <unk> <unk>
And when I go back later, and I asked them to tell them that word that I told you a <unk>
So what do you say?
The person who was told that his name is <unk> is unlikely to remember the same word that the person who was told that his job is <unk>
The same word, different capacity for <unk> that's weird.
What happens here?
Well, the name Baker, it actually doesn't mean nothing for you. It doesn't have any relationship.
With all the other memories you dance for their head.
But the word <unk> we know <unk>
They use <unk> <unk>
They have <unk>
They do well when they come back home to work.
You probably have a <unk>
And when we <unk> that word for the first time, we started putting <unk> <unk> for <unk> <unk> at some point later.
One of the most elaborate techniques to do this is a half thousand years ago in Greece <unk>
It's known as the <unk> of <unk>
The story says this: There was a poet called <unk> who attended a <unk>
They had been hired as entertainment, because before, if you wanted to give a very good party, it didn't bring to a <unk> it was <unk> to a <unk>
He stood up to me, <unk> his poem by memory, and he was <unk> and as soon as the <unk> room was <unk>
Let's get all of us.
But not only killed everyone, but it shattered the bodies of <unk>
No one could say who was there, nobody could remember where they were sitting there.
So they wouldn't be able to get the <unk>
One tragedy behind the other.
I stopped standing outside, only survivor, in the middle of the rubble, closed the eyes and realized that with the eyes of his mind, I could see where he had been sitting every single <unk>
I took the relatives of the <unk> hand where their loved ones were on the rubble.
What we <unk> <unk> at that moment is something that we all know about or less <unk> and that no matter if we are not good at remembering names or phone numbers, or instructions for the word of our colleagues, we have visual memory and rocket memory.
If you tell me that <unk> the first 10 words of the story I've just told you about <unk> is very likely to find them very difficult to do that.
But I would bet if you let me tell you who was sitting on the horse speaker, brown in his lobby, would be able to <unk>
The idea of the palace of the palace is to create this building with the eyes of his mind and image of images with the things that you want to remember. The <unk> the <unk> the <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> is the <unk>
This is a advice that comes from over 2,000 years ago, the first treated of memory in <unk>
And how does it work?
Let's say you have been invited to the TED stage to give a talk and you want to make it memory in the same way that I would have done it -- if you have been invited to <unk> 2,000 years ago.
What you might do is imagine that they're in the door of your house.
And to come up with some sort of absolutely ridiculous image image and <unk> to help you remember that the first thing you want to mention is that completely <unk> competition for you.
And then you can imagine getting into your house, and see the <unk> of the <unk> <unk> on Mister <unk>
And that would remind you that you want to introduce your friend Ed <unk>
And then you would see Britney <unk> to remind you that anecdote -- you want to count.
And then you go in the kitchen, and the fourth subject that they would talk about would be that strange journey that did for a whole year, and have some friends to help them remember it.
So this is like <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> -- not word word -- which is going to confuse you, but typical by typical.
In fact, the term <unk> comes from Greek <unk> which means <unk>
It's a <unk> of when people thought about the <unk> and in the rhetoric of this sort of space of space in space in space.
The first <unk> <unk> would be like the first place in his <unk>
I saw that this was just fascinating, and I got out of it filled with that.
I went to some of these memory skills, and I had the idea of writing a huge thing about this <unk> <unk>
But there was a problem.
The problem was that a memory competition is a <unk> event.
So seriously, it's like seeing a lot of people sitting by taking exams. I mean, the most exciting thing that's going on is when someone gets <unk>
I'm a journalist and I need to write about something.
I know there are amazing things happening in the minds of these people, but I don't have access to.
I realized that if I was going to tell this story, I needed to try to put myself in his place.
So I started to spend 15 or 20 minutes all the <unk> before sit at the New York Times, simply trying to remember something.
Maybe a poem. Or the names of an ancient <unk> child bought in a <unk> market.
And I discovered that this was a funny <unk>
I would never have expected it to do it.
It was fun, because it wasn't just about training the memory.
What is actually about doing is to make more and more the ability to create and imagine these <unk> images, I think, <unk> <unk> and hopefully <unk> in the eye of the mind.
And I was very excited about this.
This is me, using my standard standard training team for memory.
It's a couple of <unk> and some security fans with tape leaving only two <unk> because the distraction is the worst enemy of a <unk> <unk>
And I ended up coming back to the same contest that he had covered a year before. He had the idea that I could get it into a sort of <unk> experiment.
I thought this could be done of good <unk> for all my research.
The problem was that the experiment came out of control.
And I won the <unk> something I didn't have to happen.
Of course, it's nice to be able to memorize narratives and phone phone phone numbers, but actually this is not the point.
These are just <unk> <unk> that work.
Because they are based on quite basic principles about how the brain works.
And it doesn't need to be put to build memory of the memory or they memorize <unk> <unk> to benefit with a little bit of insights about how your mind works.
We often talk about people with a great memory as if it was a gift to me, but it's not the case.
Big memories <unk>
At the most basic level, we remember when we pay attention.
<unk> when we focus deeply.
The palace of <unk> These memory techniques are just shortcuts.
In fact, they're not even <unk>
They work because they make us <unk>
<unk> a kind of deep processing, sort of a complete care that most of the most is not <unk> out there.
But the reality is that there are no shortcuts.
That's how things do <unk>
And if there is something I want to leave you with today is what I would -- the <unk> that I couldn't even remember that I had a memory problem, which is the notion that life is the sum of our memories.
How much are we willing to lose what it's already is our short <unk> existence in the <unk> or <unk> not paying attention to the human being in front of us, who is walking around the side of us, we're going to be so <unk> that we don't even be able to process in <unk>
I learned from the first hand that there are some incredible memory capabilities in all of us.
But if you want to live a <unk> life, you must be the kind of person who remembers remember.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you about the last 30 years of the history of architecture.
It's a lot to cover in 18 minutes.
It's a complex issue, so we just put it just a <unk> New Jersey.
Because 30 years ago, I'm from <unk> I'm from <unk> <unk> I was six years old, and I lived in my parents' home in a village called <unk> and this was my <unk>
In the corner, from my bedroom, I was the bathroom to share with my sister.
And between my bedroom and the toilet, there was a balcony that would give the living room.
And there they spent the time watching television and every time I was going out of my room to the bathroom and everybody was <unk> and every time I went back wrapped up in a towel -- I all looked at me.
And I was like this.
It was <unk> not safe and hated it.
<unk> that journey, I hated that <unk> hated that room and that house.
That's architecture.
All right.
Those feelings, those emotions that I felt, is the power of architecture -- because architecture is not about math, and it is not about those connections, but of those connections, emotional connections, that we feel in the places that are <unk>
And it's no wonder that we feel like that, because according to the Environmental Protection Agency --  Americans spend 90 percent of their time under your roof.
I mean, 90 percent of the time are surrounded by architecture.
That's a lot.
Architecture determines us in ways that we don't even realize it.
That makes us a little naive and very, very predictable.
So this means that when you show them a building like this, I know what you're going to do -- you think about <unk> <unk> and <unk>
And I know that it was like that for based on a building built 2,500 years ago by the Greeks.
This is a trick.
It's a <unk> that uses architects to create an emotional connection with the ways that we built our buildings.
It's an <unk> emotional connection, we've used this trick for a long time ago.
We use it 200 years ago to build banks.
We used it in the 19th century to build art art.
And in the 20th century, we use it to build homes.
See, these stable, stable, <unk> in front of the sea, far away from the elements.
This is very, very useful, because building things is terrifying.
It's expensive, it takes a lot of time and it's very complicated.
And the people who are <unk> the <unk> and the governments, they always have fear of innovation, and they prefer to use shapes that are going to work.
So we found ourselves with buildings like this.
It's a nice <unk>
This is the <unk> Public Library that ended up in 2004, in my hometown, and, you know, it has a <unk> it has this <unk> columns, <unk> red, which leaves the <unk> what is trying to communicate with this <unk> the children, the human values, the story.
But it doesn't have a lot to do with a library today.
That same year, in 2004, the other side of the country, was finished another library, which looks like this.
It's in Seattle.
This library shows how we use media in the digital era.
It's a new kind of public equipment for the city, a place for everyone, reading and sharing.
So how is it possible that in the same year, in the same country, two buildings, both called libraries, are so completely different?
And the answer is that architecture works in the beginning of the <unk>
On one side is the <unk> the architects that constantly drive new technologies, new <unk> new solutions for life forms today.
We were <unk> and we did so much, we get away from the people.
All of the black, this <unk> you believe we feel very well, but we are dead in because we have no other option.
We need to go to the other side and go back to connect with those symbols <unk>
So we do that, and we are all happy, but we feel like <unk> So we started to experience <unk> we make the one step back and over and over again, so we've done it in the last 300 years, of course, in the last 30 years.
Well, 30 years ago, it was about the 1970s.
The architects were busy experimenting with the <unk> <unk>
It has to do with the concrete.
You can guess.
<unk> small, on scale.
Very hard.
So we get to the 1980s, and we started to bring these symbols.
You can see the pendulum again in the other direction.
We take those ways we know that you like and <unk>
<unk> <unk> and we put the bake and we use new materials.
They love it.
We don't take <unk>
We took <unk> and we turned it into <unk> that can be <unk> <unk> made out of glass.
<unk> won by boldness and <unk>
<unk> became columns.
<unk> grew up to the size of buildings.
<unk>
But it was the 1980s, that was great.
We all spent the time in commercial centers, we moved to the neighborhoods, and there in the suburbs, we could create our own erotic <unk>
Those fantasies could be <unk> to the French or the <unk>
It may be a <unk> of bread sticks with it.
This is what happens with <unk>
This is what happens with symbols.
They're easy, because instead of creating new spaces, we <unk> memories of other places.
I know very well, and you all know, this is not the <unk>
This is Ohio.
The architects feel frustrated and we started to make <unk> the pendulum again in the other direction.
In the early 1980s and early '90s, we started to experiment with the so-called <unk>
We have the <unk> symbols we now have new design techniques for computer, and we find ourselves with new <unk> a few ways that are stuck against other ways.
This is academic and <unk> and it's super <unk> It's totally <unk>
Typically, the pendulum <unk> again in the opposite direction.
But then something happened to happen.
And in 1997, it opened this building.
It's the <unk> of Frank <unk>
This building changed fundamentally the relationship of the world with architecture.
Paul <unk> said that Bilbao was one of those rare moments when the critical and public <unk> in general, they were completely agreed on a building.
New York Times <unk> this building of <unk>
The tourism in Bilbao grew up in a half percent, when they ended the building.
So all of a sudden, everybody wanted one of those <unk> Los Angeles, in Seattle, Chicago, New York, Cleveland, <unk>
Everybody wanted one, and Gehry was everywhere.
He was our first <unk>
But how is it possible that these wild shapes and <unk> how is it possible to become ubiquitous around the world?
And it happened, because the media is <unk> around them and quickly learned that those forms meant culture and tourism.
We've created an emotional reaction with these forms.
Same thing made the main mayors in the world.
So everybody believed that if they had these forms, they had culture and <unk>
This phenomenon of the beginning of the new millennium country went with other star architects.
He happened to <unk> and <unk> and what happened with these few elite architects on the threshold of the new millennium, actually started to go through all of architecture, digital media started to increase the speed of information consumption.
Think for example, how do we consume architecture.
A thousand years ago, you have to have walked to the next town to see a building.
<unk> <unk> can take a boat, an airplane, can be <unk>
<unk> technology, you can see in the newspapers, on TV, and in the end, we are all photographers of architecture, and the building is carried beyond its physical location.
The architecture is everywhere, that means that the speed of communications has finally reached the speed of architecture.
Because architecture is moving so fast.
They're not very accurate enough to think about a building.
It takes a lot of time to build a building, three or four years old, and at that time, an architect can design two, eight, or 100 more buildings before that, when I was designed four years ago was success or not.
Because there's never been good feedback in architecture.
So this is how we find buildings like this.
The <unk> was not a two years, but 20 years.
For 20 years, we were building buildings like this because we had no idea how much we <unk>
That is never going to happen to <unk> because we are at the threshold of the largest revolution in architecture from the invention of the <unk> or the <unk> and it's the media revolution.
My theory is that when the pendulum applies to media, it starts to <unk> faster and faster to being in both extremes almost in <unk> and actually <unk> the difference between innovation and symbol, between us, architects and you, the audience.
We can now make symbols as much <unk> with an emotional burden of something completely new.
I'll show you how the system works in a project that my company ended up recently.
We were <unk> to replace this building that <unk>
This is the center of a village called <unk> Island, in the state of New York City.
It's a community of vacation.
But that meant that two years before the building, the building, was already part of the community, and as the drawings looked exactly at the end of the end, there was no surprises.
The building came to be part of the community, that first summer, when people started to get and share it in social media, the building stopped being a building -- it became a media, because these are not just images of a building, and it's the images that you did from the building.
And as you use it to tell your story, they become part of the personal narrative -- and that makes it <unk> with the collective memory, and when we charge these symbols, we learn.
I mean, we don't need the Greeks tell us how to think about architecture.
We can tell each other what we think about architecture -- because digital media has not only changed the relationship between us, but they've changed the relationship between us and the buildings.
Think about a second in those librarians in <unk>
If that building was built today, first of course, to the Internet looking for <unk> <unk>
We were bombarded with examples of examples of examples of innovation, what can a library.
That's <unk>
<unk> that you can carry the mayor of <unk> to the people of <unk> and tell them that there is no unique response to what a library can be today.
Let's be part of this.
This abundance of solutions gives the freedom to experiment.
It's all different now.
The architects are no longer those mysterious creatures that use words <unk> and drawings and <unk> and you're not a <unk> public who doesn't take something that hasn't seen before.
The architects can listen, and you don't leave it for architecture.
That means that the pendulum <unk> from one style to another, of one movement to another, is irrelevant.
In fact, we can go ahead and find right solutions to the problems facing society.
This is the end of the architecture story, and it means that the buildings in the morning will be very different from the buildings today.
This means that a public space in the ancient city of <unk> may be unique and adapted to the measure of a modern city.
This means that a stadium in Brooklyn can be that, a stadium in Brooklyn, and not a bad <unk> historical <unk> based on ideas of what it must be the <unk>
So this means that some robots can be able to build our buildings, because we will ultimately be ready for the ways that are going to produce.
That means that the buildings will be attributed to the whims of nature and not the opposite.
This means that a garage parking lot in Miami Beach, Florida, Florida, it can also serve to do a sport or <unk> or even you can get married in the night.
This means that three architects can dream of swimming in the East <unk> in New York City, and raising half a million dollars of the community together around that cause, it's already not a customer alone.
It means that no building is too small for innovation, like this little pavilion of <unk> so <unk> and <unk> like the animals that are going to observe.
Because no matter if it's a cow or a robot who builds our buildings.
It doesn't matter how we built, what we build.
The architects already know how to make buildings more <unk> more intelligent and more kind.
We've been waiting for all of you to want them.
Finally, we're not on the opposite side.
Find an architect, <unk> and work together to make better buildings, better cities, to a better world, because there is a lot of play.
Buildings are not only reflecting our society, but they give them a way to the most <unk> spaces, the local libraries of the homes where we form our children, and the <unk> <unk>
Thank you very much.
This is my <unk> <unk>
It just turned a year and she started walking.
And it does this very cool way of the children of a year, <unk> as if his body was moving too fast for their legs.
It's totally <unk>
And one of the things that most likes to do for the moment is to look at it in the mirror.
She really loves his reflection.
It was laughing and <unk> and it gives itself those big kisses and <unk>
It's beautiful.
And apparently, their friends do this and my mom tells me that I used to do it, and I was thinking, "When are I trying to do this?
How is it that we suddenly are not comfortable with our <unk>
Because, apparently, we don't like it.
Every month, 10,000 people are looking at the Google: "I'm <unk>
This is <unk> it's 13 years old and lives in <unk>
And as any teenager just wants to be sick and fit in.
It's Sunday at night.
It's preparing for next week in school.
It's a little bit of fear, because even though his mom tells you all the time that it's beautiful, every day in school, somebody says it's ugly.
Between what his mom tells you and what his friends, or fellow in the school said, doesn't know who believe.
So a video of her himself, he publishes it on YouTube, and he asks others that please let a <unk> "I'm nice or <unk>
Well, until now, <unk> has gotten over 13 comments.
Some of these are so <unk> who don't even deserve the worthwhile to think about them.
We talk about a regular and normal teenager, who gets these responses in one of the most vulnerable life stages emotionally emotionally in the most emotionally direction.
Thousands of people are posting as this one, mostly teenage girls trying to communicate this way.
But what is it going to do this?
Well, adolescents are almost never alone.
They're under pressure of being online and available all the time, talking, <unk> giving you <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
We've never been so connected before we have been so connected to a continuous way, so <unk> so young.
As a mother said to me, "It's like a party in his fourth <unk>
There's just no privacy.
And social pressures that go from hand with that are <unk>
This environment, being always connected -- it's <unk> to our children to <unk> based on the number of likes they have and the kinds of comments that they do.
There is no division between a life online and real life.
It's really hard to know the differences between what's real or what it isn't.
And also, it's very hard to know the difference between what is authentic and what it is <unk> <unk>
What is the most dramatic thing in the life of someone in front of what is normal in a <unk> context.
And where are you looking for the <unk>
Well, you can see the kind of images that are <unk> from the news of girls now.
<unk> zero continue to dominate our <unk>
<unk> technique is now a routine.
And trends like, <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk>
For those of the <unk> <unk> means <unk>
These trends are associated with women in the popular culture today.
It's not hard to see what young people compare
But kids are also not immune to this.
Like the superheroes of sport, and the singers are <unk>
But what is the problem with all this?
Well, we certainly want our kids to grow healthy and be <unk> individuals.
But in a culture obsessed with the image, we're teaching our children to spend more time and mental effort to their appearance, the price of all other aspects of their identity.
Things like their relationships, the development of their physical skills, their studies and other aspects start to be hurt.
Six of the 10 girls would prefer not to do something because they think they don't see the nice good enough.
These are not <unk>
They're fundamental activities for its growth as human beings and <unk> to society and the work of labor development.
<unk> percent, almost one in three teenagers are not interested in the <unk> <unk> participating in the <unk> <unk> because they don't want to call the attention for their physical <unk>
One in five are not attending the classes for the days when you don't feel comfortable about it.
And in the tests, if you don't think you see you all right, specifically if you don't believe that you're very, very thin, you get it a smaller note to the average of your fellow people who don't care about why appearance.
And this phenomenon has been widespread in Finland, America and China.
It gives it regardless of what these young people actually weigh with.
So, to make sure of course, of course, we're talking about how you see you, not what you're really like.
The low self-esteem of your body is <unk> the academic performance.
And it's also <unk> the health.
<unk> with little self-esteem are doing less physical activity, they eat less fruit and vegetables, in more diet they don't healthy than they can take it to a food disorder.
They have low self-esteem.
They're more easily <unk> by the people around them and are at the most risk of depression.
And we think that's all about what they make decisions more <unk> like alcohol consumption and drugs, diet -- aesthetic surgery, sexual relationships to early and no protection and damage.
The perfect body for the perfect body is pushing into the healthcare system, and our government costs billions of dollars every year.
And we're not <unk>
Women who believe they have overweight again, regardless of whether they have or they have no higher rates of <unk>
The 17 percent of women are not presented to a job interview in a day that they don't feel secure with the way you see them.
Think about a moment in what this is doing to our economy.
If we could overcome this, which would be that <unk>
So let's make this potential for each one of us.
But how do we do that?
Well, speaking, for itself, it doesn't take you very far.
It's not enough.
If you really want to change things, you have to do something.
And we've learned that there are three key shapes, the first one is that we need to instill trust in their own body.
We need to help our adolescents to develop strategies to overcome the pressure of perfect images and build their self-esteem.
The good news is that there are lots of programs available to it.
The bad news is that most of these don't work.
I was very impressed when I learned that a lot of serious programs <unk> without realizing the situation.
So we have to make sure that the program that follows our children are not only a positive impact, but also an lasting impact.
And research studies show that the best programs focused on six key areas, the first is the influence of family, friends and relationships.
These six aspects are expected to be crucial to anyone willing to provide an education on your body self-esteem to work.
An education is a <unk> but tackle this problem requires each of us to take charge in the issue, and let's be a better model to follow women and girls in our own lives.
So challenging the status of the time as women are seen and mentioned in our circles.
It's not good to tell the input of our political <unk> or the size of your <unk> or the size of your <unk> that the determination or the success of an Olympic athlete depends on the fact that it's not a great beauty.
We need to start judge people for what they are, not as you see them.
And all of us can start by making responsibility for the type of images and comments that we published in our social networks.
We can bring it to people based on their effort and their actions and not in their appearance.
And let me ask you, when's the last time you get a <unk>
In short, we have to work together as communities, like governments and governments and like companies, to truly change our culture, so that our children will grow to be valuing all of their person, valuing the individuality, the diversity, the <unk>
We need to put the people that really marking the difference in a <unk>
To make a difference in the real world, let's make them be the ones that go out on the big screen, because we just create a different world.
A world where our children are free to become the best version of themselves, where the way they think they see never the <unk> of being who they are, or what they want in their lives.
Think about what this can mean for someone in their lives.
Who do you have in mind?
He <unk>
He <unk>
He <unk>
His <unk> A <unk>
It could be simply the woman who is two car seats, what would it mean for her if he was released from that <unk> voice in his interior, which would tell him because she didn't have a long legs -- a more <unk> <unk>
What would it mean for her if we were going to do this, and we would call their potential for that way?
Right now, the obsession of our culture is <unk> to all.
But let's make our children the truth.
You know, the way you see you is just a part of your identity, and the truth is that we love them who are and what they do, and as as they feel.
We went to the self-esteem in the <unk> of our schools.
Let's change each of us, the way we talk about, and we compared to other people.
And we work together as a community, from small groups to governments, so that the small <unk> of a year of today, will become agents of safe change tomorrow.
And let's do it.
The five of November 1990s, a gentleman named <unk> <unk> walked into a hotel in Manhattan and killed the rabbi <unk> <unk> the leader of the League of Defense <unk>
First of all, he was an innocent guy, but he was a prisoner for the other <unk> in the company of others, started planning on their heart of New York City, including <unk> <unk> and the U.N.
So luckily, those plans will be absorbed by an FBI <unk>
Sadly, the 1993 bomb in the World Trade Center couldn't get rid of it.
He was later <unk> it would be convicted of their participation in that <unk>
<unk> <unk> is my father.
I was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1983, being a <unk> engineer, with a loving American <unk> teacher in high school -- the two made everything possible for giving me a happy childhood,
Just when I was seven years old, our family started to change.
My father taught me a way of Islam, that a very few, including most Muslims will ever meet.
I saw that when people take time to interact, it doesn't need a lot to be able to make the same things in life.
And yet, in all religion, in every human group, there is always a small fraction of people who were <unk> so <unk> to their convictions that think that we need to use all the possible media for everyone to live like them.
A few months before he was married with me and explained that in the last weekend, he sat up with me and some friends, had been going to training in Long Island, to practice.
He told me that I would go with it the next day.
We got to the <unk> I throw <unk> which, without knowing our group, was <unk> by the FBI.
When I got <unk> my father helped me hold the <unk> on the shoulder and explained to me how to aim for about 30 meters.
That day, with the last bullet that shot the little <unk> I gave the little orange light on the goal and, to surprise everybody, especially mine, all the goal broke into flames.
My uncle went back to others and in Arabic, he said <unk> <unk>
As a parent, maybe a son.
And all of us, the comment produced a lot of laughter. But just a few years later, I understood what they were so funny.
Did you see in me, the same level of destruction that my father could have.
Those people later would be committed to put a <unk> with 700 kilos of explosives in the underground parking lot of the World Trade Center, causing a explosion that killed six people and transferred to other 1,000.
I admired those men.
He called it <unk> which means uncle.
When I turned 19, I had moved 20 times. That instability for my childhood not allowed me to do a lot of them.
Every time I started to feel comfortable about somebody was already time to pack and go to another city.
As it was always me the new face of the class, it was often victim <unk>
My identity is to avoid the whites but to be the new class of the class, silent and <unk> was enough <unk>
So most of the time I spent the time reading books, watching TV or playing video games.
For these reasons I didn't develop social skills, to put it <unk> to grow under <unk> I wasn't prepared for the real world.
I was opera to judge people, based on indicators and <unk> like race or religion.
So how could I open the eyes?
One of the first experiences that they put in the test of the test of thinking, was during the 2008 presidential elections.
In a <unk> program that I participated in the National Convention <unk> in Philadelphia.
My group was <unk> in the subject of juvenile violence, like I had been a victim of <unk> almost all my life, was something that I felt so much passion.
The members of this group came from different <unk>
One day, at the end of the <unk> I found that one of the guys who we had done, friendship, was Jewish was Jewish people.
It took several days to go out of light this detail and realized that there was no <unk> between the two.
I had never had a Jewish friend and frankly I was very proud to have to beat the barrier that all the life had made me believe that it was <unk>
Another crucial moment came when I got a summer job in the Bush <unk> an amusement park.
I found myself with people all kinds of beliefs and cultures. That experience became fundamental in the development of my character.
The whole life had been taught that the <unk> was a sin and by extension, all gay were bad <unk>
By the chance, I had the opportunity to work with gay actors there, in a show, and I could see that several of them were the most nice and less critics who had seen in life.
Having been <unk> as a child, I developed a sense of empathy to the suffering of others -- but it wasn't easy for me to treat people, exactly the way I wish we would be treated.
For that feeling I was able to contrast the stereotypes that had taught me as a child, with the experience of interaction in real life.
I don't know how to be homosexual but I know what it is to be <unk> for something beyond my control.
Then came the <unk> <unk>
Every night, Jon Stewart made me be <unk> honest about my <unk> and I helped me see that race of the people, religion or sexual orientation, you have nothing to do with character.
In many ways, he became my shape <unk> at a moment when I was desperately <unk>
Sometimes the inspiration can come from the unexpected thing, and that a Jewish comedian would have had a better influence in my life than my father, <unk> was not in vain.
One day I had a conversation with my mother about how I was changing my way to think, and she told me something to hold on my heart forever, while she's alive.
She looked at me with my tired eyes of somebody who has suffered enough with endless <unk> and he said, "I'm tired of <unk>
At that moment I realized how much negative energy you need to keep all that hate <unk>
My real name is not <unk> <unk>
It changed when my family decided to break the relationship with my father and start a new life.
So why do I decided to go out and put into a possible risk?
Well, it's simple.
I've done that because I hope that somebody else is going to take the violence, you know, to hear my story and understand that there is a better way -- that even though I was given to this violent ideology and <unk> I didn't get to make me <unk>
On the contrary, I decided to use my experience to fight terrorism and <unk>
I do it by the victims of terrorism and their loved pain and the losses that terrorism has produced them in their lives.
For the victims of terrorism to speak against these acts of <unk> like rejection to the actions of my father.
And with this simplicity I put on here as the proof that violence is not an inherent of any religion or race, that children don't have to follow the trails of their parents.
I'm not my father.
Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you.  Thank you very much.
At this point, there is a film that is projects in your minds.
It's an incredible movie.
It's in 3D and it has sound that you hear about and see right now, but that's just the beginning.
Your movie has <unk> taste and texture.
You feel your body, your pain, your hunger your pleasure.
It has emotions, anger and happiness.
It has memories, like moments of your childhood that project in front of your eyes.
And it has constantly a voice superimposed on your conscious thinking.
The heart of the movie is you who experience everything seriously.
This film is your flow of consciousness, the subject of the experience of the mind and the world.
Consciousness is one of the fundamental truths of the existence of the existence of the human being.
Each one of us is conscious.
We all have an internal house, you, you, and you and you.
There is nothing to be able to get it more directly.
At least I know I have a <unk>
I don't have any sure that you are conscious.
<unk> is the reason to live.
If we were not aware of it in our lives it would make sense or value.
But at the same time is the most mysterious phenomenon in the universe.
Why are we <unk>
Why do we have these movies <unk>
Why are we not just robots that are <unk> what we get to produce the results without experiencing the movie <unk>
So at this point, nobody knows the answers to those questions.
I suggest that to integrate consciousness in science, you need some radical ideas.
Some people say it's impossible a science of consciousness.
Science -- by nature, is objective by nature.
<unk> by nature, is subjective <unk>
So there may never be a science of consciousness.
Because for almost all the 20th century, we would have that vision.
The psychology was studying human behavior, the neuroscience of the human brain, but nobody mentioned consciousness.
Even 30 years ago, when TED started, there were very few scientific jobs on consciousness.
<unk> 20 years ago, it all started to change.
<unk> like Francis Crick and physicists like Roger <unk> they said, <unk> is the moment for science <unk> <unk>
And since then, there was a real danger, a <unk> of the scientific work on consciousness.
And this work was fantastic. It was great.
But it also has fundamental limitations to the moment.
The center of the science of consciousness in recent years, was the pursuit of <unk> correlations between some areas of the brain and some states of consciousness.
We saw some of this guy in the fantastic work that introduced Nancy <unk> a few minutes ago.
We now understand a lot better, for example, the areas of the brain that are related to the conscious experience of seeing faces or feel happy or feeling happy.
But this is still a science of <unk>
It's not a science of science.
We know that these areas of the brain are related to certain kinds of conscious experiences, but we don't know why.
I would like to explain that this kind of work of neuroscience responds to some questions that we want to explain consciousness. The questions about what certain areas of the brain and what are they <unk>
But in a sense, those are the easy problems.
You don't have to offend the <unk>
There's actually no easy problem with consciousness.
So it doesn't deal with the real mystery of the central mystery of this <unk> why all the physical process in the brain has to be accompanied by consciousness?
Why is there a <unk> <unk>
So at this point, we cannot understand.
And you can say, let's give it a few years to the neuroscience.
It's going to turn into another emerging phenomenon, like <unk> like life, and we're going to find explanation.
The typical <unk> are all cases of emerging behaviors, how do we operate <unk> how do we work <unk> how are the <unk> and <unk> the living organisms are all questions about how the goal works.
So that could be applied to the human brain to explain some behaviors and the functions of the human brain as a <unk> phenomenon, how do we <unk> how we speak, how we play <unk> all of these questions about behavior.
But when it comes to consciousness, the questions about behavior are among easy problems.
But the hard problem is the question for why is that everything is accompanied by a <unk> experience.
And here it is, the standard paradigm of the <unk> the standard paradigm of neuroscience, really still has a lot to say.
I am a scientific <unk>
I want a scientific theory of <unk> that works. For a long time, I was beating his head against the wall looking for a theory of consciousness in pure terms of physical terms that would work.
But at the end of the end I got to the conclusion that that wasn't working for reasons for <unk>
I think we would get rid of this point.
We have a wonderful supply chain, so cool. We get used to this, the physics explains chemistry, chemistry explains biology, biology explains a part of psychology.
But consciousness doesn't seem to fit into this scheme.
On the one hand, it's a fact that we are conscious.
On the other, we don't know how to accommodate that idea to our scientific vision of the world.
I believe that consciousness, is a kind of <unk> something that we need to integrate in our view of the world, but we don't know how.
With a anomaly like this, you can need radical ideas, I think we need ideas that at the beginning, crazy, before we can deal with awareness of a scientific way.
There are some possibilities for these crazy ideas.
My friend Dan Dennett, who's here today, has one.
His crazy idea is that there is no such a difficult problem of consciousness.
The whole idea of the internal subjective film includes some sort of illusion or confusion.
In fact, what you have to do, is to explain the functions in the brain of the brain -- and so I studies everything that needs about explanation.
Well, more power for him.
That's the kind of radical idea that we need to explore if we want to have a theory of pure consciousness based on the brain.
At the same time, for me and for many others, that vision is pretty close to simply denying that the observation of consciousness is <unk>
But I am in a different direction.
In the time that we have, I want to explore two crazy ideas that I think can be <unk>
The first crazy idea is that consciousness is critical.
The physicists sometimes take some aspects of the universe like bricks that space, the space and the mass.
<unk> fundamental laws like the laws of gravity or quantum mechanics.
These laws and fundamental properties are not explaining in terms of any more basic.
On the contrary, you think about it principles, and that is built the world.
Sometimes, the list of the fundamental list is <unk>
In the 19th century, <unk> <unk> they found that you can't explain electric phenomena in terms of fundamental concepts <unk> space, time, <unk> laws of Newton. So I applied the basic laws of <unk> and applied the electrical charge as a fundamental concept that those laws are <unk>
I think that's the situation that we find ourselves with consciousness.
If you can't explain consciousness in terms of fundamental ideas -- time, mass mass, the <unk> so for a matter of logic, you have to save the list.
The most natural would be <unk> the consciousness itself as a fundamental <unk> a fundamental brick of nature.
This doesn't mean that suddenly is not the object of science.
It opens the way to <unk> scientifically.
So what we need is to study the fundamental laws that govern consciousness, the laws that connect consciousness with other fundamental concepts -- space -- time, the mass, the physical processes.
The physicists sometimes tell us that we want very much basic laws that we can put them into a <unk>
<unk> situation is something like this.
We want to find fundamental laws that we can put them in a t-shirt.
We still don't know what laws are, but that's what we're looking for.
The second crazy idea is that consciousness can be universal.
Every system can have a degree of consciousness.
This is sometimes called <unk> <unk> for all of us, <unk> by mind, every system is conscious, not only humans, the dogs, the mice, even the microbes of Rob <unk> the elementary particles.
Even a <unk> has some degree of consciousness.
The idea is not that photons are smart or <unk>
It's not that a <unk> can be full of distress when you think about it, I always go traveling the speed of light.
I can never slow down and smell the <unk>
No, no.
But thinking of thinking is that maybe photons may have some element of feeling raw, subjective -- some common precursor to consciousness.
This may sound a little crazy for you.
How would someone think about something so <unk>
And in part this comes from the first crazy idea, which consciousness is a fundamental thing.
If it's fundamental like space, the time and the mass, it's natural to assume that it can also be universal, just like the others.
It is also worthwhile to notice that even though the idea seems to us, it's much less for the people of different cultures, where the human mind seems to be a continuum with nature.
A deeper reason comes from the idea that perhaps the most simple and powerful form of finding fundamental laws that are thinking about thinking with the physical process, is <unk> the consciousness with information.
Whenever there is information processing -- there's consciousness.
<unk> of <unk> complex, like in a human, complex awareness.
<unk> of simple information, simple awareness.
One very exciting thing is that in the recent years, a neuroscientist, a <unk> <unk> took this type of theory and developed it with mathematical methods.
It has a mathematical measure of information integration, which calls <unk> which measures the degree of information integrated into a system.
And it's supposed to do with consciousness.
So in a human brain, there's an incredible degree of information integration, a high degree of <unk> a lot of consciousness.
In a mouse there is a kind of a half of information integration, the same very significant, degree of consciousness quite important.
But when you get the worms, microbes, microbes, the degree of <unk> <unk>
The level of information integration, it's smaller but it's not zero either.
In <unk> theory, there's still a level of a different point of zero.
It actually raises a fundamental law of <unk> high degree of consciousness.
Moreover, another reason is that <unk> can help us integrate consciousness in the physical world.
The physicists and philosophers have often observed that physics is curiously abstract.
It describes the structure of reality using a lot of equations, but we don't talk about the reality underlying the underlying reality.
As he explains Stephen Hawking, where does the fire of <unk>
From <unk> vision, the equations of physics can be made as they are, but you can use to describe the flow of consciousness.
That's what physicists do basically describe the flow of consciousness.
To this vision, consciousness is the one that puts fire in the equations.
In that vision, consciousness is not about the physical world as a kind of <unk>
It's right in the center.
This vision, I think, is the <unk> vision, has the potential for <unk> our relationship with nature, and it can have social and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical and ethical consequences.
Some can be <unk>
I used to think that I didn't have to eat anything that had consciousness, then I had to be a <unk>
If you're a <unk> and you accept that vision, you'll have a lot of hungry.
I think I think of it, this tends to transform your vision, as what matters in ethical terms and <unk> is not so much the fact that consciousness, but its importance and complexity and complexity.
It's natural to ask awareness in other systems, like computers.
What about the artificial intelligence system of Samantha <unk>
It's <unk>
According to the view of <unk> information, she has an complicated information processing processing so that the answer is yes, if it's conscious.
If this is right, they are very serious ethical problems about the ethics ethic of intelligent computers and the ethics ethic.
Finally, you can ask for your collective consciousness, the planet.
Canada has its own consciousness?
Or a more local level, an integrated group, like the audience at a TED Talk -- at this moment we have a collective conscience -- a internal movie for this whole group of TED, different from the inner movies of every single <unk>
I don't know the answer to that question, but I think at least it's a question that needs to take seriously.
So this <unk> <unk> is a radical view, and I don't know if it's correct.
I'm actually more secure than the first crazy idea, which is a fundamental thing, which is a fundamental thing that is universal.
The vision raises a lot of questions, a lot of challenges, like, how do those bits of thinking contribute to the kind of complex consciousness that we know and love it.
If we can answer those questions, then I think we're going on the right way to a theory of serious awareness.
If not, you know, this is probably the hardest problem of science and philosophy.
We can't wait to solve it from night to the morning.
But I think we finally will figure it out.
Understanding consciousness is the real key, I think, to understand the universe and to understand ourselves.
Maybe we just need the crazy idea.
Thank you.
I grew up in a small rural village in Victoria.
He had a very normal profile, a low education.
I went to school, I was fascinated with my friends, I was fascinated with my younger sisters.
It was all very normal.
And when I was 15 years old, a member of my community came up to my parents because I wanted to <unk> for a <unk>
And my parents said, "Well, that's very nice, but there's an obvious problem.
She has actually gotten nothing."  And they were right.
I went to school, I had good grades. After the school, I had a low profile on the <unk> of my mother, and spent a lot of time looking at the series of <unk> the <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk>
Yes, I know. What a contradiction.
But they were right.
I did nothing that was extraordinary at all.
Nothing can be considered as a achievement if we take the disability out of the equation.
So a few years later, I was in the second part of teaching high school at a high school of <unk> so only after about 20 minutes in the 11 minutes of studies, a guy raised his hand and said, "Hey, when will you give your <unk>
I said, "What's <unk>
Well, I had been talking about the law of <unk> for good good minutes.
And he said, "You know, your <unk> <unk>
When people in <unk> they talk about <unk> things at school?"
"Why?" in the <unk> hall.
And it was when I realized, this child had had experiences with people with disability as an inspiration.
And we are. And it's not the boy, I mean, that's true for many of us.
For us, people with disability are not our teachers or our doctors or our <unk>
We're not real people. We're there for inspire.
And in fact, I'm on this stage <unk> what I do in this <unk> chair and probably you are waiting for you. Right?  Yes.
Well, ladies and gentlemen, I fear <unk> <unk>
I'm not here to <unk>
I'm here to tell you that they've lied to us in relation to disability.
Yes, it has sold us the lie that disability is a <unk> <unk> <unk>
It's a bad thing and living with a disability that's remarkable.
It's not a bad thing and it's not able to make you remarkable.
And in the last few years, we've been able to spread even more this lie through social media.
You may have seen images like this: "The only disability is a bad <unk>
Or this <unk> "Your <unk> <unk> <unk>
Or this <unk> "Before <unk> <unk>
These are just a couple of examples, but there is a huge amount of them.
You may have seen one, of the girl without the hands drawing with a pencil <unk>
You may have seen a kid who runs through the carbon fiber of carbon.
And there are a lot of these images, which is what we call inspiration inspiration,
And I use the <unk> porn term -- because we had a group of people for the benefit of another group of people.
So in this case, <unk> at the disability in the benefit of people without disabilities.
The purpose of these images is <unk> <unk> so we can see them and think, "Well, so bad that my life may be worse.
I could be that person."
But if you're that person?
I've lost the account of the number of times that I've been dealing with strange <unk> to express that you believe I'm brave or a source of inspiration, and this was going to happen before my work had a public profile.
It was like I was excited to get up in the morning and remember my own name.  And this is <unk>
These images, those images will lead to people with disability in the benefit of people without disabilities.
They're there so you can see them and think that things aren't so bad for you, or to put your concerns in perspective.
And life as a disabled person is actually a hard thing.
We have a few things.
But the things we overcome are not the things that you can think of.
They're not relative things relative to our bodies.
I use the term <unk> <unk> deliberately <unk> because I was <unk> by called the social model of disabilities, which tells us that we are more active because of the society in which we live than because of our bodies or diagnostics.
So I've lived in this body for a long time.
I'm very <unk> with him.
The things that I need to do, and I've learned to pull the best of your ability to like this, and that's what happens with the children of those pictures as well.
They're not doing anything out of the common.
They are simply using their bodies by taking the best of their ability.
So it's really just <unk> in the way we do that, by sharing those <unk>
When people say, "You're a source of <unk> it tells you as a compliment.
And I know why it does.
It's because of the lie, because they have sold this lie that disability makes us quite remarkable.
And honestly, I don't do it.
And I know what you're thinking.
I'm here -- the inspiration, and you think, "Oh God, you're not going to be inspired by anything?"
And actually, I know I am.
<unk> of other people with disability every time.
However, I don't know that I'm more lucky than them.
This is a great idea to use a <unk> <unk> to pick up the things that fall over.  <unk> the ingenious trick of how to charge the battery on the cell phone on the chair of the chair.
Great.
We learn from force and resistance of others, not against our bodies and our <unk> but against a world that <unk> and <unk>
I really believe that the lie that has been sold to us about disability is the greatest <unk>
It makes us hard life.
And that <unk> "The only disability in life is a bad <unk> the reason that that's lie because it's not true because of the social model of disability.
A lot of smiles in a range of stairs hasn't done it never to become a <unk>
Never.   <unk> on a television screen won't make the <unk> <unk>
Not a lot of people in the middle of a bookstore and <unk> a positive attitude all those books to the <unk>
It's just not going to happen.
I want to really live in a world where disability is not the exception, but the norm.
I want to live where a 15 year-old child sitting in your bedroom watching <unk> the <unk> <unk> doesn't be considered <unk> of nothing for being on a chair.
I want to live in a world where we don't have so low expectations of people with disability that we would be <unk> for <unk> and remembering our names in the morning.
I want to live in a world where we value genuine achievement of people with disabilities, and I want to live in a world where a 11 year-old boy in Melbourne is not a little surprised that his new teacher is a <unk>
<unk> does not make us <unk> but question what you believe to know about what you do.
Thank you.
What do you have to see augmented reality and professional soccer with <unk>
And what is the average speed of a <unk> <unk>
Unfortunately, today I'll just answer one of those questions, so please don't get paid.
When people think actually <unk> they think about "Minority <unk> and Tom <unk> <unk> the hands in the air, but augmented reality is not science fiction.
<unk> reality is something going to happen in our days and is going to happen because we have the tools for it, and people need to know it, because augmented reality will change our lives as much as the Internet and mobile phones.
So, how do we get to the <unk>
The first step, is what I wear <unk> Google <unk>
I'm sure many are familiar with them.
What you may not know is that Google <unk> are a device that lets you see what I see.
It will allow them to experience what is being a professional <unk> in the field.
Right now, the only way to be in the field is that I try to <unk>
I have to use words.
I have to create a framework that you fill with your imagination.
We can use the Google Glass, underneath a helmet and know what is run by the game camp to 160 <unk> the blood <unk>
We can know it feels like a man of 110 pounds of 110 pounds of trying to make it all their self.
I've been there and I assure you that it's not nice.
And so I took some videos to show you what is to use Google <unk> under the helmet, give them an idea of that.
Unfortunately, they're not images of <unk> because the idea of the <unk> technology is an underwater going up to the surface. But we do what we can.
So let's see a video.
Chris <unk> Come on.
It's horrible to be <unk>
A moment of <unk> a little bit.
<unk>
Go!
Chris <unk> As you can see, it's a <unk> of what is being <unk> in the football field, from the perspective of <unk>
You may have noticed that lack people, the rest of the team.
We have a video of them, <unk> from the University of Washington.
<unk> <unk> Mice -- Mice <unk>
Blue 8, Blue <unk> Go!
Chris <unk> This is a little bit more like feeling in the field, but it has nothing to do with being in the <unk>
<unk> want that experience.
The <unk> want to be in the field, to be their favorite players -- and have asked me on YouTube and in <unk> <unk> you can see from the angle of a field <unk>
Or a <unk>
We want to experience that."
Once we have that experience with <unk> and Google Glass, how do we get in the next <unk>
We took it to that level using something called <unk> <unk> that surely you know it.
The Rift <unk> has been described as the most realistic reality device ever created, and it's not cheap <unk>
And I'm going to show you why why is this video.
Man: Oh, no.
No, no, no! I don't want to keep <unk> No!
Oh my God. Ah!
<unk> That's the experience of a man in a roller coaster -- for his life.
What is the experience of a fan when you put a video of Adrian <unk> across the line, <unk> from a <unk> with the arm before you run and make a <unk> What's the experience of a fan of a fan
When I can be <unk> running by the <unk> launching the ball of the network?
What your experience is when you get out of a mountain to more than 100 miles per hour like a <unk> <unk>
Maybe it's <unk> the sales of diapers for adults.
But this is not even <unk>
It's just virtual reality, <unk>
How do we get the reality of <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> reality when <unk> and owners see the information that people want to see and think, "How do we use this to improve our <unk>
How do we use it for <unk>
Because they always use technology to gain.
They like to win. They give them money.
So, here's a quick rendering of technology in the <unk>
In 1965, the Baltimore <unk> put a <unk> to their <unk> <unk> to play faster.
They won the Super Bowl that year.
Other teams decided to <unk>
More people saw the game because it was more exciting, faster.
In 1994, the <unk> put radii in the <unk> of the <unk> and then in the defenses.
They had more viewers because it was more quick, more entertaining.
In <unk> imagine that you are a player coming back to your group and you see your next little thing that you show in front of you, in a plastic bombsight that you carry on <unk> you have no longer to worry about forget a <unk>
It or <unk> the strategy.
They just go out to the camp and react.
And the coaches want it, because if they don't keep their instructions, they lose them, and they hate to lose <unk>
If you lose parties <unk> as a coach.
And they don't want that.
But augmented reality is not just a manual of <unk> strategies.
<unk> reality is also a way to collect information and use it in real time to improve your game.
How would you do this?
Well, a very simple option would be to have a camera in every corner of the stadium having a view from the top of the people that's down.
You also get information from the <unk> sensors and <unk> something that's already working on.
And all that information is the <unk> of your <unk>
The good teams will know <unk>
The bad ones will have information <unk>
And so this teaches good teams of bad guys.
So your computer equipment is going to be as important as your <unk> and data analysis will stop being for <unk>
I'll be also for <unk> Who would have <unk>
How would it be in the country?
Imagine that it's the field.
They took the ball and <unk>
We went to an open receptor -- all of a sudden, a <unk> on the left part of your bombsight -- that a defense behind you is going to <unk> you don't know it, but the <unk> system will be <unk>
It will go into the area of protection.
Another <unk> you tell you that there's an open <unk>
You get the <unk> but you get <unk>
And the ball loses the trajectory.
You don't know where we land, however, the receptor sees it in their bombsight a area of grass that lights up and can modify the race.
It takes the <unk> it runs the <unk> runs on and <unk>
The <unk> and the fans have followed the flow of every angle.
This is something that creates a massive emotion in the game.
I'm going to do you know that a lot of people see it, because people want to live that experience.
<unk> want to be in the field.
They want your favorite player.
<unk> reality will be part of the sports because it's too profitable to not be.
But what I ask you is: we want this to be the only use of reality <unk>
We're going to use it only as bread and <unk> like the <unk> entertainment.
Because I think we can use it for something else.
I think we can use augmented reality to foster empathy among human beings, to show someone what it is, literally, being in the other person's place.
We know what this technology is worth for <unk>
It generates billions of revenue a year.
But how much is this technology for a professor in the classroom trying to show a <unk> how bad their actions from the perspective of <unk>
How much is this technology for a gay gay gay in Uganda or Russia trying to show the world how is being <unk>
How much is it worth of a <unk> <unk> or an Neil <unk> <unk> trying to inspire a generation of children to think more in space and science instead of sticky notes and <unk>
Ladies and gentlemen, the augmented reality is coming.
The questions that we do, the choices we take and the challenges that we face, and the challenges that we face, as usual, we do.
Thank you.
I came up with me after 23 years of service in the <unk> <unk> of California.
Most of those 23 years was the <unk> the southern tip of <unk> County, which includes the Golden Gate bridge.
The bridge is a <unk> structure, which is called the world for beautiful San Francisco <unk> the Pacific Ocean and his inspirational architectural <unk>
Unfortunately, it's also a magnet for suicide, being one of the most used places in the world.
The Golden Gate Bridge was open in <unk>
Joseph <unk> engineer the CEO of building the bridge, said that, "The bridge is practically <unk>
<unk> from the bridge is not practical and <unk>
But from his openness, over 1600 people have jumped to their death from that bridge.
Some people believe that travel between the two towers will bring them to another dimension, this bridge has been <unk> as such, that each of your concerns and pain, and the waters that pass underneath your soul.
But let me tell you that happens when the bridge is used to commit suicide.
After a free four to five seconds, the body hits the water about 120 miles an hour.
The impact it breaks bone, some of which will lead vital organs.
Most people die in impact.
The ones that don't usually get rid of the water <unk> and then they <unk>
I don't think that <unk> this method of suicide will realize the death of the death that they <unk>
This is the wire.
Except about the two towers, there's 32 inches of steel parallel to the bridge.
So here is where most people are just before they get their life.
I can tell you for experience that once the person is on that boundary, and at the most dark time, it's very hard to bring them back.
I took this photo last year while this young woman spoke with an officer looking for his life.
I want to tell you with joy that we had success that day to bring it back on the <unk>
When I started working on the bridge, we didn't have any formal training.
<unk> to channel the way through these calls.
This was not just a bad service for those who were paying for suicide, but officials as well.
We've come a long way since then.
Today, official officers and psychologists train new official people.
This is Jason <unk>
I met him the 22 of Julius last year when you get a call of a <unk> subject sitting in the <unk> <unk>
<unk> and when I got there, watched Jason speaking to Jason talking with an official World bridge.
Jason was only 32 years old, and there was flown up to here from New Jersey.
In fact, there were flown over to here two times before the New Jersey to try to commit suicide from this bridge.
After about an hour talking to <unk> we asked if we knew the history of the box <unk>
<unk> the mythology <unk> <unk> created <unk> and he sent the Earth to the Earth with a box, and he said, <unk> never open that <unk>
Well, one day, curiosity could get more than <unk> and she opened the box.
She came out of <unk> <unk> and all kinds of <unk> against man.
The only good thing in the box was hope.
So Jason said, "What if you open the box and there's no <unk>
He stopped about <unk> leaned on the right, and he did.
This kind of kind and smart guy in New Jersey had just got out of <unk>
I talked to the parents of Jason that night, and I guess when I was talking to them, it didn't seem to be ringing very well, because the next day, the rabbi of the family called me to see what I was.
The fathers of Jason had the <unk>
<unk> damage affects a lot of people.
I ask you these questions: What would you do if a member of your family, a friend or someone loved were suicide outside.
What do you say?
What do you say?
In my experience, you don't only have to talk, but you need to listen.
Listening to understand.
Not <unk> <unk> or say to the person you know how it feels because you probably don't know it.
Just being there, you can be the inflection point that you need.
If you think that someone is <unk> you don't have afraid of <unk> and ask the question.
One way to ask you the question is: <unk> in similar circumstances have thought to finish their life, you've had these <unk>
They can save the person in front of it can save the life and be the inflection point for them.
Other signs to <unk> despair, believe that things are terrible, and they're never going to be able to make sure that there is nothing you can do to <unk> social isolation -- and a losing interest in life.
I came up with this talk just a couple of days, and I got an email from a lady and I'd like to read you your letter.
She lost his son on the 19 of January of this year, and he wrote this email just a couple of days, and it's with his permission and blessing I read it.
"Hi, <unk> I imagine you're at the TED conference.
It must be a whole experience to be there.
I'm thinking that I should go to the bridge this weekend.
I just wanted to leave you a note.
I hope you can tell a lot of people and go home talking about it to your friends talking about it to your friends, and so on.
I'm still pretty <unk> but noticing more moments of realizing that Mike won't go home.
Mike was driving from <unk> to San Francisco to see the <unk> game with his father the 19 of January.
It never came there.
I called the police officer and <unk> that night.
The next morning, two officers came to my home and reported that the <unk> car was down on the bridge.
A witness had seen him jump from the bridge to the <unk> of the day before.
Thank you very much for fighting for those who can be temporarily too weak to fight for themselves.
Who hasn't been wrong with a real mental disease.
It must be that easy to end up with it.
My sentences are in your struggle.
The <unk> the Golden Gate Bridge is supposed to be a passage through our beautiful bay, not a cemetery.
Good luck this week, <unk>
I can't imagine the value that she needed to go to the bridge and tour the way his son took that day, and also the courage to go ahead.
I'd like to introduce you to a man that I mean with hope and value.
On March 11, 2005, I wrote a radio call by a potential subject suicide on the sidewalk sidewalk near the north.
I went on the front sidewalk and watched this man, Kevin <unk> standing on the sidewalk.
When he saw me, I immediately saw the <unk> and stopped in that little tube that goes around the tower.
In the next half and half the next time, I heard like Kevin spoke about his depression and despair.
Kevin decided for his account to come back on that lane and give it another opportunity.
When Kevin turns out, I got it.
"This is a new beginning, a new life."
But I asked him, "What did it did was he did the <unk> and gave you the hope and the other <unk>
And you know what he told me?
He said, "I am <unk>
They stopped me talking and simply <unk>
Shortly after that incident, I received a letter from my Kevin, and I have that letter with me, and I would like to <unk>
"Dear Mr. <unk> Nothing to erase the 11th of March, and you're one of the reasons that Kevin follows with us.
Honestly, I think Kevin was <unk> for help.
It's been diagnosed with a mental illness for which it has been properly <unk>
I went to Kevin when I only had six months, completely unconscious of all those traits -- but thank God, we now know.
Kevin is in order, like the <unk>
We give God for you.
<unk> in debt with you, <unk> <unk>
And at the end she writes <unk> When I visited the General Hospital at San Francisco that night, you <unk> like the patient.
<unk> I had to be <unk>
Kevin is a <unk> father and an active member of the society.
It speaks openly about the events of that day and their depression with the hope that their story will inspire others.
suicide is not just something I have found myself at work.
It's personal.
My grandfather was <unk> with poison.
That act, despite the end of their own pain, theft.
This is what suicide.
For most people <unk> or those who consider the suicide, wouldn't you think about someone else.
They just want their own <unk>
Usually this is achieved by three things: sleep, the drugs or death.
In my career, I've responded and I've been involved in hundreds of mental illness and calls about the bridge.
And in those incidents that I've been directly involved in that have just lost two, but those two are too much.
One was <unk>
The other one was a man who talked about about an hour.
During that time, I was <unk> in three times.
On the end, I looked at me, and he said, "I am sorry, but I have to go."
And <unk>
<unk> absolutely awful.
I want to tell you, though, that the great majority of the people that we get to contact on that bridge is not <unk>
Also, those few who have jumped from the bridge and lived and you can talk about it, that one percent or two percent, most of those people have said that the second that they let the railing realized they had made a mistake and they wanted to live.
I tell people, the bridge doesn't just connect to <unk> with San Francisco, but the people.
That connection, or the bridge that we do, is something that all and every one of us should be able to work to do.
<unk> can prevent.
There is hope.
Thank you very much.
The world makes you be what you don't are, but in your inside, you know what you are, and a question will tell you, how do you get it?"
I must be a unique thing in that sense, but I'm not alone.
When I became a model model, I was finally able to have achieved the dream that I had had since a child.
My outside finally <unk> with my inner truth with my inner self.
For complicated reasons, the ones I'm going after later, when I look at this picture, I think, <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
But last October I discovered that <unk> I'm beginning.
We all get rid of our families, our religion, our society, our moment in history, even our bodies.
Some of them have the value of <unk> to get rid of the color of the skin by the color of the skin or for the beliefs about those around us.
They are people who are always challenging the status quo -- which is considered <unk>
In my case, the last nine years, a lot of my neighbors, many of my friends, my agent, even ignored my story.
I think this mystery is called revelation.
This is mine.
I was recorded as <unk> at birth because of the appearance of my genital
I remember my five years in the Philippines, in my house, I always wore this t-shirt on the head.
And my mom was going, "Why do you always get that t-shirt in the <unk>
I said, "Mom, it's my hair. I'm a <unk>
I knew then how to <unk>
The gender is always considered a <unk> but now we know that, really, is something more complex and mystery now.
Because of my success, I never challenged myself to share my story, not because I thought it will be a bad thing, but why the world is about the ones that want to <unk>
I thank you to be a woman.
I have a mama, Dad and family who embrace me as I am.
Many are not so lucky.
There's a long tradition in the <unk> culture that celebrates the mystery of gender.
There's a Buddhist goddess of compassion.
There's a goddess of <unk> goddess of <unk>
And when I was eight years old, I was at a party in the Philippines that celebrated these puzzles.
I was in front of the stage and I remember this beautiful woman appeared in front of me, and I remember that moment as if something happened to me, this is the kind of woman I would like to be.
And when I was 15 years old, when I was still wearing a man, I met this woman called <unk>
It's the director of a contest of beauty <unk>
That night she asked me, "Why haven't you ever been involved in the <unk> competition.
He told me that if she <unk> she was given to the <unk> and the <unk> and that night, he won on the bathroom, he won on <unk> <unk> and she was third <unk> among over 40 candidates.
That moment changed my life.
Suddenly, I was within the world of beauty.
Not many people can say that their first work was from queen of women's women, but I can.
I also met the goddess of <unk> especially when I went to the remote provinces of the <unk>
But more important than all that, I met my best friends in that community.
In 2001 my mom who had moved to San Francisco, he called me and told me that he passed my <unk> to the green card that I could go to live in the U.S.
I was hooked.
I told my mother -- "Mom, I'm <unk>
I'm here with friends, I like to travel and be a queen of <unk>
But then, two weeks later, he called me and said, "Do you know if you gave the U.S. to change the name and the identity of the <unk>
It was all I needed to hear.
My mom suggested I was to put two <unk> to my name.
She also accompanied me when I was standing in Thailand to 19 years.
It's curious that in some of the most rural cities of Thailand do the most sophisticated and secure.
At that time, in the U.S., it was necessary to be done before they change the name and gender.
So in 2001 I went to San Francisco, and I remember looking at <unk> license with the name of <unk> and the gender <unk>
It was a great time.
For some people, their identity calls means being able to drive or be able to get a <unk> but for me it was the license to live, to feel <unk>
Suddenly, my fears saw <unk>
I felt I could conquer my dream and move to New York City, and to be model.
Many are not so lucky.
I think of this woman of <unk> <unk> <unk>
A young woman in New York who <unk> she was living his truth, but he said, <unk> put his life.
For many of my community, that's the reality that they live.
Our suicide rates are eight times higher than the rest of the population.
All 20 of November we do a global <unk> by <unk> Day.
I am on this stage because of a long history of people who <unk> and stood up to injustice.
These are <unk> P. Johnson and Sylvia <unk>
Today, I'm coming out of the closet.
I can't keep living my truth, just for me.
I want to do the best to help others to live their truth without shame, or fear.
I'm here, <unk> for some day no longer there is no longer any more than 20 percent <unk>
My deepest truth led me to accept what I am.
Will you you?
Thank you very much.
Thank you, thank you, thank you.  <unk> <unk> <unk> a quick question.
<unk> <unk> Sure. First of all, thank you with all my <unk>
I was to my own network of support, my parents especially, to my family, which is very strong.
I remember all the times that I've been to young women who have taught young women who have <unk> and sometimes when they called me and told me that his parents couldn't embrace it, I would call my mom and said, "Mom, you can call this <unk>
Sometimes it worked -- other people don't. It's just gender identity, that's what is in the center of what we are, right?
I mean, we all assigned a gender to birth, and what I try to do is to put on the table that sometimes the theme that sometimes that would not block -- and that there should be a space that allowed people to <unk> and this is a conversation that we should have with parents, with colleagues.
The <unk> movement is <unk> compared to the gay movement.
There's still a lot of work to do.
There should be understanding.
There should be space for curiosity and to ask questions, and I hope that all of you are my allies.
KS: Thank you. Very nice.
In a lot of creative and tribal societies, the parents are usually known for their children, but I'm one of the few parents who are known for his daughter and I'm proud of it.
<unk> started his campaign for education defending his rights in 2007. And when he was <unk> their efforts in 2011, to <unk> the National <unk> Prize was made very famous and a very popular girl in his country.
Before that, I was my daughter, but I'm now his father.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you take a look at the history of mankind, the history of women is the story of the <unk> of inequality, of violence and exploitation.
You see, in the <unk> societies right from the beginning, when when when when when you're born a girl, his birth is not <unk>
It's not welcome, nor your father or his mother.
The neighborhood comes next to the mother and nobody <unk> the father.
And a mother was getting a lot for a little girl.
When it gives birth to the first child, the first child, it gets sad.
When it gives birth to the second daughter, he <unk> and, with the hope of a son, when he <unk> his third daughter, she feels guilty like a criminal.
Not only the <unk> mother, but the <unk> daughter <unk> when it grows, it suffers as well.
At the age of five years, when I should go to school, it stays home and the school one of his siblings.
At the age of 12 years, somehow, it has a good life.
You can <unk>
It can play with your friends on the street, and you can move through the streets like a butterfly.
But when it comes into adolescence, when it comes to 13 years old, he calls it out of his home without a male <unk>
It's confined to the four walls of their house.
It's no longer a free person.
It becomes called the honor of his father and his brothers and his family, and if you were to make the code of that of the honor, honor, it could even kill it.
And it's interesting that this means of honor, not just affects the life of a <unk> also affects the life of male members of the family.
So this brother, <unk> the <unk> of his life and the happiness of his sisters in the name of honor.
And there's a rule of <unk> societies, which is called <unk>
It's supposed to be very <unk> very humble and very <unk>
It's the <unk>
The model of a good girl must be <unk>
It's supposed to be <unk> and that makes the decisions of their father and her mother and the decisions of the elderly even if you don't will.
If the <unk> with a man who doesn't like or if the <unk> with an old man has to be <unk> because she doesn't want to be <unk> <unk>
If the <unk> too young, it has to embrace it.
Otherwise, the <unk> <unk>
And what happens to the end?
In the words of a <unk> "The <unk> the <unk> and then it gives birth to more children and <unk>
And the irony of the situation is that this mother, <unk> the same lesson from <unk> to his daughter and the same lesson for his children.
And this vicious cycle continues and it continues.
<unk> brothers and sisters, when was born <unk> and for the first time, believe me, I don't like the newborns, to be honest, but when I was there, and I looked at his eyes, believe me, I felt incredibly <unk>
And a lot before I was born, I thought about her name, and I was fascinated with a <unk> <unk> of freedom in Afghanistan.
His name was <unk> <unk> and I called my daughter so for her.
But when I was <unk> everyone was men, and he grabbed my pen, and I took a line of my name, and I wrote, <unk>
And when she came out, when she was four and a half and a half and a half years in my school.
You might be wondering, why should I mention the board of a child in a school?"
Yes, I must <unk>
You can give it for granted in Canada, in the United States, but in a lot of developed countries, but in the poor countries, but in the poor countries, it's a great event for the life of a child.
<unk> in a school means the recognition of his identity and your name.
A high school means that it has entered the world of dreams and aspirations where it can explore their potential for your future life.
I have five sisters, and no one of them could go to school, and they would be <unk> two weeks earlier, when they <unk> the <unk> form and was in the relative part of the family, couldn't remember the <unk> of some of my sisters.
And the reason I was never seen the names of my sisters written in any document.
That was the reason for my daughter.
What my father couldn't give my sisters and his daughters, I thought I had to change it.
I used to appreciate the intelligence and <unk> of my daughter.
<unk> to sit with me when my friends came to me.
The encouraged to go with me to different meetings.
And all of these values, I've tried to focus on their personality.
And this wasn't just for her, just for <unk>
I've got all these good values in my school to girls and boys alike.
I used education for <unk>
<unk> my daughters, I taught the students, forget the lesson of <unk>
I taught the students to forget the lesson of the so-called <unk>
They had siblings and sisters, sisters, for more rights for women, and <unk> to have more and more space for women in society.
But we had a new phenomenon.
It was lethal rights for human rights, and in particular, for women's rights.
His name was <unk>
That means a complete complete denial of women's involvement in all and economic and social activities.
Hundreds of schools were lost.
girls are banned to go to school.
Women were forced to use <unk> and they stopped going to markets.
The musicians were <unk> the <unk> girls and the singers were <unk>
It was <unk> millions, but a few <unk> and it was terrifying to have around those people who kill and <unk> when you talk about their rights.
It's really terrifying.
At 10 years, you know, <unk> got up and raised by the right to education.
He wrote a newspaper for the BBC, of the BBC, -- was offered herself to the New York Times documentaries and he talked about every platform he could.
And his voice was the most powerful.
It was <unk> like a <unk> around the world.
And that was the reason that the Taliban couldn't stand in their campaign and December October of 2012, was hit by <unk> on the head.
It was a <unk> day for my family and me.
The world became a great black hole.
Whereas my daughter was <unk> between the life and the death, he told me the ear to my wife <unk> <unk> for what happened to my daughter, <unk>
And <unk> he said, "Please don't bother you."
Let's get the fair cause.
<unk> your life in play because of the cause of peace, because of the cause of education, and your daughter inspired in you and <unk>
They were both on the right way and God <unk>
These few words were a lot to me, and I didn't go back to ask again.
When I was <unk> I was in the hospital and he had strong headaches and strong headaches and his facial nerve, I was cut, I used to see a dark shadow that went on by the face of my wife.
But my daughter was never <unk>
I used to say, "I'm okay with my smile <unk> and the <unk> in my face.
I'm going to be okay. Please don't get <unk>
It was a comfort for us, and it was <unk>
<unk> brothers and sisters, have learned from her how to resist the most difficult moments, and I'm happy to share with you that even though being an icon for children and women and women, is like every 16 year-old girl.
<unk> when they don't finish his task.
They fight with his brothers, and I'm very happy for that.
People ask me, "What's especially in my <unk> who has made so bold to <unk> so courageous and expressive <unk>
I'll tell you what I did.
<unk> what I didn't do.
I didn't cut their wings and that's it.
Thank you very much.
Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank you.
I was <unk> the brain is 18 years ago, and since that day, the science of the brain has become a personal passion.
I'm engineering.
And I want to tell you that I've recently joined me at the Google <unk> <unk> where I've had a <unk> to my <unk> the <unk> of Google <unk> but all the work that I'm talking about today about the brain science, I did before I join Google or outside my work there.
Having said this, there's a stigma when you get to a brain operation.
You are still just as smart or not?
Not like this, you'll be able to be <unk>
After the <unk> I was missing a part of the brain, and I had to live with it.
It wasn't the gray, but it was the <unk> sticky part of the center that creates important hormones and <unk>
And immediately after the operation, I had to decide how many of it would take, from more than a dozen more chemicals every day, because if I didn't take anything, it would die in a few hours.
Every day, for the last 18 years, I've had to decide about the combinations and mix of chemicals, and try to get them to live with life.
More than I have saved me.
But, luckily, I have a soul of <unk> so I decided that I was going to try to get the <unk> dose, because there is really no clear map that says it in <unk>
I started to try and mix with different <unk> and I was shocked to see how small changes on the dose changed dramatically my sense of who I was, my sense of thinking, my behavior with others.
One particularly <unk> case for a few months, I tried a dose and ordinary chemicals for a man of <unk> and I was just surprised to see how my thinking changed my thinking.
I was always <unk> I thought all the time on sex, and I thought it was the smartest person around the world, and --  -- of course, a lot of times in the past I've met several guys, or perhaps some <unk> versions of it.
It turned out like a extreme.
But my great surprise was that I wasn't trying to be <unk>
In fact, I was <unk> so much <unk> to fix a problem that I had on the front, just wouldn't happen like this.
So I couldn't handle it.
I changed my <unk>
But I think that experience I gave me a new appreciation of men and about what they have to do, I have been better with men.
What I was trying to do is adjust those hormones and neurotransmitters and others, it was to regain my intelligence after disease and <unk> my creative thinking, my flow of ideas.
I used to think about almost always in imagery, and that became my key point of reference, how do I get those mental images that I use to create <unk> my ideas, if you were going to make new ideas and make new situations.
This kind of thoughts is not new.
<unk> like <unk> Descartes and <unk> see things in the same way.
They thought images and mental ideas were the same thing.
So today, there are people who challenge this idea, and there are a lot of discussions about how the mind works, for me is simple: for most of us, the mental images are fundamental to the <unk> and <unk> thinking.
So after a number of years, I got to find the point right and I have a lot of great mental <unk> which is really sophisticated and very sophisticated <unk>
Now, I'm working on how to bring these mental images of my mind to the screen screen screen.
Can you imagine what would happen if a film director was able to use his imagination just to drive the world that has the <unk>
Or if a musician, I could get the music of your head?
There are incredible possibilities with this, like the way people creative people can get to share the speed of light.
And the truth is, the only difficulty for achieving this is simply to increase resolution of our brain scanning systems.
So let me show you why I think we are pretty close to get to this with two recent experiments that was done by two studies in neuroscience.
They are both used <unk> technology and functional MRI to represent the brain, and you can see the brain scan done by <unk> <unk> and his colleagues at Harvard.
The column on the left shows the scanning of the brain of a person looking at an image.
The column of the middle shows the scanning of the brain of that same individual as you can see that same image.
The column on the right is created <unk> the contents of the central column on the left of the left.
This is <unk> in many different individuals with lots of different images, always with a similar outcome.
The difference between seeing a picture and imagine seeing that same image is almost <unk>
Now, let me share with you another experiment. This is from the Jack <unk> lab in Berkeley, California.
They managed to convert brain waves into visual fields.
Let's put it this way.
In this experiment, I showed people hundreds of hours of YouTube videos as they were <unk> their brains to create a great pool of reactions in the brain before the video sequences.
And then I showed you a film with new images, new new animals, and as long as they were <unk> a new <unk>
The computer, using only the brain information of the scanning brain <unk> to show what it looked like the person was looking at.
On the right you can see the <unk> of the computer, and on the left, the video that I showed you.
This blew up to us.
We're pretty close to that.
We just need to improve the resolution.
And now, remember, when you see a picture and when you can imagine that same image, you create in the brain the same <unk>
This was done with the largest scanning brain scanning systems available today, and their resolution for a thousand times in the last few years.
Now we need to increase resolution a thousand times more to get a deeper look.
How did we do this?
There are a lot of techniques to do that.
One is to open the skull and introduce electrodes.
I don't offer you for that.
A lot of people are proposing new techniques of projection into imagery, even me, <unk> with the recent outcome of the <unk> we need to ask the next, this technology will be the end of the <unk>
The conventional wisdom says that the only way to gain greater resolution is with bigger magnets -- but at this point, magnets more <unk> only offer small improvements on the resolution, not increases for thousands as we need.
I propose this idea, rather than bigger magnets -- rather than bigger magnets.
We can create a lot more complex structures with a little bit more complex sense, like making a <unk>
So why does this matter?
Over the last few years, a huge amount of effort in MRI were to make really big, right?
However, most recent advances in the <unk> of ingenious and brilliant solutions in <unk> and <unk> and <unk> in females and tomato receptors in the MRI system.
At their time, instead of a magnetic field, they were able to prescribe magnetic patterns and structured <unk> to radio frequencies <unk>
So when we combine the magnetic patterns with the patterns of <unk> radio processing patterns, we can increase the information that can be taken out in a single <unk>
Moreover, we can then split up in layers of our increasing knowledge of the structure of the brain and the memory to create the increase in the thousands we need.
By using <unk> we should be able to measure not only the fluid fluid, but the hormones and the <unk> that I mentioned and perhaps even neural neural activity, this is sleep.
Will we be able to put our ideas in a direct way to digital media.
Can you imagine if we could go above language and communicate directly through the <unk>
What would we be <unk>
And how do we learn to deal with the truths of human thinking without <unk>
You thought the Internet is a big thing.
These are great questions.
It would be <unk> to use it as a tool to amplify our thinking and communication.
Now this same tool could lead to the cure of Alzheimer's and similar disease.
We have a few more options that open this door.
Anyway, you choose a year to happen in five or 15 years?
It's hard to imagine that it will take much more.
We need to learn how to take this step together.
Thank you.
I'm going to talk to you tonight about coming out of the closet, and not just a traditional sense, not just the gay <unk>
I think we all have <unk>
His closet may be saying to some person for the first time that the loves or tell someone who is pregnant, or tell someone who has cancer, or any other hard conversation why you have ever <unk> in life.
<unk> <unk> is a difficult conversation, and even though our issues can be <unk> the experience of I've experienced and have come out of that closet is universal.
It's afraid, and we don't like it, and it must happen.
A lot of years ago, I worked in the South Side <unk> I worked in the South Side of the city, and being there, I had to go through multiple phases of the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> my armpits, quote the letters of <unk> gave me <unk> as a <unk>
And I will be slope that by the <unk> of my pants <unk> and I had <unk> my head -- I would usually ask you a little boy, "Hey, you're a kid or <unk>
And they would find an awkward silence at the table.
I got my jaw a little bit further, it would take me my coffee with a <unk>
The father was <unk> the newspaper and the mother tossed a cold <unk> look at his son.
But I would never say anything, and we went down inside.
And I came to the point that every time I went to a place where there was a child between three and 10 years, I was ready to fight.
And that's a terrible feeling.
So I promised you that the next time I would say something.
I should have that hard conversation.
So after a few weeks, it came back again.
"You're a guy or a <unk>
A family silence, but this time was prepared and was about to get into the female issues at the table --  I had the quotes out of Betty <unk>
The Department of Gloria <unk>
Even a fragment of the "Vagina Monologues" I <unk>
And so I got a lot of <unk> and my backs went down and my backs and my backs -- a little girl in four years with a pink dress -- looking at what is not a challenge for a feminist <unk> just a little girl with a question: "Are you guy or <unk>
And so I took a lot of a little bit of <unk> and I said, "Hey, I know this is something <unk>
I have the short hair like a boy, and I saw a girl, but I'm a girl, and you know, like you like to use a pink dress and sometimes you like to use a comfortable pajamas.
Now, I'm more of the kind of <unk> pajamas.
And that little girl looked at me and he said, "My favorite pajamas is <unk> and he has a fish.
You can give me a <unk> for <unk>
And that was the whole thing. "Oh, OK. You're a girl.
What about the <unk> <unk>
It was the easiest conversation for everyone ever had.
And by <unk> because the girl of the <unk> and I, both of us were <unk> the one with the other.
So as many of us, I've lived in some <unk> in my life, and yes, often, my walls used to be a <unk>
But inside, you can't know what color the walls.
You just know how a closet.
This is how my closet is not different from yours or yours or yours.
I was going to give you a hundred reasons why I get out of my life was harder than coming out of his, but this is the thing: The hard thing is not <unk>
The hard thing is hard.
Who can tell me that to explain to somebody who have declared to banking in banking is harder than saying it has been <unk>
Who can tell me that this story that I tell you is harder than saying to your son of five years you're going to be <unk>
There's no more difficult thing, just the hard thing.
We need to stop classify what is difficult for us to do something that is difficult for another person to make us feel better or worse in relation to our <unk> and we need to just feel empathy because we all live something hard.
At some point in our lives, we all live in <unk> and they can make it feel security, or at least more security than the other side of the door.
But I'm here to tell you that no matter what your walls, a <unk> is not a place to live.
Thank you.  Imagine yes 20 years ago.
I, who had a horse tail, a dress and a <unk> shoes.
He was not the militant lesbian prepared to fight every child in four years to get in the coffee.
I was frozen because of <unk> <unk> in a corner of my dark closet -- my uncle gay, and the moving only muscle is the scariest thing I've ever done.
My family, my full strangers have spent my entire life that I've spent my entire life trying not to <unk> and now the world turned on to purpose.
He was burning the pages of a script that we've all followed for so long, but if you don't toss that <unk> you kill you.
One of my <unk> launches was on my sister wedding.
It was the first time that a lot of the guests were able to know that I was gay, and when I do my <unk> <unk> in my <unk> and <unk> I walked around the tables and finally came to one where the friends were the friends of my parents' friends, people who knew me years ago.
And after talking to a moment, one of the women cried <unk> <unk> <unk>
And the battle of the gay story had begun.
Have you ever been in the <unk>
"Well, yes, the truth is that we have friends in San <unk>
"Well, we've never been there, but we heard it is <unk>
<unk> You know my <unk> <unk>
It's very good and never talked about having <unk>
You know, what is your TV TV show.
Our <unk> Will and Grace <unk>
And you know who <unk> <unk>
Jack is our <unk>
And then a woman, <unk> but trying to be desperately <unk> to get me to know that I was on my side, he finally said, "Well, sometimes my husband uses artificial shirts <unk>
And I had an opportunity at that time, like you have all the Scud <unk>
<unk> could have been easy to indicate where they felt <unk>
It's not very difficult to find them and realize the fact that they were <unk>
And what else can you ask someone, but <unk>
If you're going to be authentic with someone, you have to be prepared for the authentic thing that you want.
This is how the hard conversations continue without being my strong point.
Ask anyone who I have <unk>
But I'm getting better, and I keep what I like to call the three principles of the Girl <unk>
Now, please see this through the <unk> perspective, but you understand that what it means to go out of any <unk> is essentially the same thing.
Number one: Be authentic.
<unk> <unk> Be yourself.
That girl in the coffee didn't have <unk> but I was ready for the battle.
If you want someone to be <unk> the others need to know it also <unk>
Number two: Be <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
If you know they're gay, <unk>
If they say their parents may maybe be gay, they will keep the hope that that could change.
Don't give them a sense of false hope.
And number three, and more important important --  Let the complex stuff.
You communicate your truth.
They would never get rid of that.
And some of you can go out safe, <unk> so they have done, but I'm never sorry for what they are.
And yes, maybe some of you will feel <unk> but that's not in you.
Those are the expectations of them about what you are, but not your own.
That's the story of them, but not of you.
The only story matters is that you want to write.
So the next time you find in a dark <unk> you have a <unk> you must know that we've all been there before.
And you might feel very love, but they don't.
Thank you, <unk> Enjoy the <unk>
So what is that?
If you look at the story of what intelligence has been seen -- an productive example has been the famous quote by <unk> <unk> that "The question of if a machine can think of is as interesting as the question of if a submarine can be <unk>
When <unk> <unk> wrote this as a critical to the computer <unk> as Alan <unk>
And so a few years ago, we made a program to try to understand the fundamental physical mechanisms underlying intelligence.
Let me step one step.
We first start with a mental experiment.
So imagine that you are from a alien race that you don't know about the biology of the Earth or the neuroscience of the Earth or the intelligence of the Earth, but they have incredible telescopes, and you can see the Earth, and they have incredibly long lives, so you can see the Earth for millions, even billions of years.
And you see a very strange effect.
Of course, as <unk> we know that the reason we are trying to save ourselves.
We're trying to avoid an impact.
But if you're from a alien race that doesn't know anything about this, which has no concept about intelligence on Earth, you would see forced to develop a physical theory that would explain how, even a moment in time, the asteroids that are <unk> the surface of a planet -- they stop doing it.
And so I claim that this is the same question that of understanding the physical nature of intelligence.
So in this program that took a number of years ago, I looked at a variety of issues across science, through various disciplines, that <unk> I think, towards a single underlying mechanism of intelligence.
In <unk> for example, there have been a variety of evidence that our universe seems to be <unk> adjusted for the development of intelligence, and in particular, for developing states of universal states that will promote the diversity of possible future.
Finally, in the planning of robotic movement, there have been a variety of recent techniques that have tried to harness the skills of robots to maximize the future freedom of action in order to perform complex tasks.
And so by taking all these different themes and <unk> together, I said, for a few years ago, there's a underlying mechanism for intelligence that we can extract from all these different <unk>
There's only one equation for intelligence?
And I think the answer is yes. What you're seeing is probably the closest equivalent to a E = <unk> for the intelligence that I ever saw.
So what you're seeing here is a claim that intelligence is a force, F, that acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action.
It acts in order to maximize the future freedom of action, or keep the open choices with a direct force with the diversity of possible future accessible, yes, even an imminent time, <unk>
In a nutshell, the intelligence doesn't like to stay <unk>
Does the intelligence try to maximize the future freedom of action and maintaining the open.
And so, having to account this equation, it's natural to ask, what can you do with this?
How much is it?
<unk> the level of human intelligence.
<unk> intelligence.
So I'm going to show you now a video I think, I'll show some of the amazing applications of this simple equation.
Narrator: <unk> research in cosmology have suggested that universes that make more disorder, or <unk> during their life should have to be able to have more favorable conditions for the existence of intelligent beings like us.
But what if that <unk> connection between entropy and intelligence is a more <unk> relationship.
What if intelligent behavior is not only correlates with the production of entropy in the long term, but actually actually emerges from her?
To find out, we've developed a software engine called <unk> designed to maximize the production of entropy in any system that can be found inside.
Amazingly, <unk> could go through multiple animal intelligence, play games of human intelligence, and even earn money <unk> actions, all without the wrong thing to do that.
Here are some examples of <unk> in action.
Just like a <unk> <unk> here we see <unk> <unk> automatically pole using a pole <unk>
This behavior is remarkable partly because we never gave a goal.
He just decided for her to balance the <unk>
This ability to balance will have applications for robotic robotics and human assistance technologies.
This ability to use tools will have applications in intelligent manufacturing.
In addition, just like some other animals can cooperate pulling opposite opposite of a rope at the same time to release the food, here we see that <unk> can perform a version of the model of that task.
This ability of cooperation has really interesting consequences for economic planning and in a variety of other fields.
<unk> is widely applicable in a variety of <unk>
For example, here is successfully playing a game of <unk> against itself, <unk> their potential for play.
Here we see <unk> orchestrate new connections in a social network where the friends are constantly <unk> and keeps the net right here.
This same capacity to <unk> it also has applications in health care, energy and intelligence.
Here we see <unk> organizing the routes of a fleet of boats, finding success and using the Panama Canal to expand the world level of the Atlantic to the Pacific.
In the same way, <unk> is widely applicable in defense and logistics and transportation.
Finally, here we see <unk> spontaneously discovering and run a strategy of <unk> <unk> in a simulated series of actions, successfully increasing assets under its exponential management.
This ability of risk management will have huge applications in finance and safe.
Alex <unk> What you've seen is that a variety of brands of intelligent cognitive behaviors such as the use of tools, walking upright and cooperation -- all derive from one equation, which leads to a system to maximize their future freedom of action.
Now, here's a profound <unk> here.
So let's go back to the beginning of the use of the term -- the <unk> work -- there was always the concept that if we were able to use smart machines, there was some <unk> rebellion in the beginning.
The machines are <unk> against us.
One of the greatest consequences of this work is that maybe all these decades, we've had the whole concept of rebellion to the other way.
It's not that machines first become smart, and then they try to take away the world.
It's all the opposite, that the impulse to take control of all the possible future is a more fundamental principle than the intelligence of intelligence, that the general intelligence can actually arise from taking control, rather than being backwards.
Another important consequence is the search for the goal.
They often ask, "How is it to look for goals about this kind of <unk>
My equivalent of that statement to go to the descendants to help them build artificial <unk> or to help them understand human intelligence, is this: The intelligence must be seen as a physical process that tries to maximize the future freedom of action and avoid the restrictions in their own future.
Thank you very much.
We're at an inflection point in human history, something between the <unk> of stars and losing the planet that we call <unk>
Except, in the last few years, we've expanded a lot of our knowledge of how it fits the Earth in the context of the universe.
The Kepler mission of NASA has discovered thousands of possible planets orbiting other stars, which is where the Earth is only one among the billions of planets in our galaxy.
Kepler is a space telescope which measures the dim intensity of the stars when planets go in front of them, put a little bit of that light that comes to us.
The data gathered by Kepler show the sizes of planets in addition to the distance that there is between them and their mother.
And so this helps us understand if these planets are small and <unk> like the land planets of our solar system, and also the amount of light that they get from their <unk>
At its time, this is clues about whether these planets that we find are habitable or not.
Unfortunately, while we're finding this trove of worlds potentially <unk> our own planet is <unk> under the weight of humanity.
The year 2014 was the hottest <unk>
<unk> and sea ice that have been with us for millennia, now are now disappearing for decades.
These environmental changes that we've caused a global scale have <unk> our ability to disrupt their course.
But I am not a weather scientist and <unk>
But I study the <unk> of the planet influenced by the stars, with the hope of finding places in the universe where to discover life beyond our planet.
You might say I'm looking for alien opportunities in the sector developer.
Now, as a very interested in the quest for life in the universe can tell you that the more look for the similar planets to the Earth, more enjoy our own planet.
Each of these new worlds invites a comparison between the <unk> planet, and the planets that we know better -- our solar system.
Let's take our neighbor to Mars.
Mars is small and <unk> and despite being a little bit farther away from the Sun, it can be considered a potentially <unk> world showing this for a mission like <unk>
In fact, it is possible that Mars has been habitable in the past, and in part, that's why we studied both to Mars.
Our <unk> like <unk> track their surface in search of clues about the origins of life as we know it.
The satellites that <unk> like the <unk> mission -- they take samples of the atmosphere, and try to understand how Mars has been able to lose their <unk>
Companies now offer not only short space flights but also the possibility of living on Mars.
But even though all these <unk> images remind the deserts of our planet, places that are linked in our imagination with the <unk> ideas and <unk> compared to the Earth, Mars is a pretty terrible place to live.
Let's take the extension of the <unk> areas of our planet that are still <unk> places that are really <unk> compared to Mars.
Even in the most dry places on the Earth, the air is cool and filled with oxygen <unk> by our tropical forests for thousands of miles away.
I worry that this enthusiasm for the colonization, of Mars and other planets will pull a big and sad <unk> the implication and the belief of some that Mars would expect there to save this <unk> <unk> of the only planet, we know that it's truly <unk> the Earth.
For a lot of me that I like to look at my exploration, I'm deep disagree with this idea.
There are a lot of good reasons to go to Mars, but to say that Mars will be there to be there for humanity to be the captain of the Titanic to be able to imagine the captain of the Titanic to tell you that the party actually will have place in the <unk>   Thank you.
But the goals for ocean exploration and the Earth preservation is not <unk>
No, they are actually faces of the same <unk> the goal of understanding, to preserve and improve life in the future.
The extreme environments present in our world look like <unk> <unk>
They get closer to home.
If we can understand how to create and keep <unk> spaces in the hostile areas of the land, we might be able to meet the need to preserve our environment and go beyond that.
So let me leave you with an <unk> experiment. <unk> paradox.
So many years ago, the physicist Enrico Fermi asked me to have to realize that our universe has existed for a long time, and we hope that there were many planets in this universe, we should have found evidence of the existence of alien life so far.
Well, where are they?
Well, a possible solution to the paradox of Fermi is that when civilizations become advanced advanced enough to consider to live between the stars, they lose the notion of the important thing that is to protect the origin of the planets that we have this development.
It's arrogant to think that only colonization <unk> will save us from ourselves, but the <unk> planetary exploration, can work together.
If we really believe in our ability to look at the hostile environments of Mars for human presence, then we should be able to overcome the whole task even easier to preserve the <unk> on Earth.
Thank you.
A few years ago, I was going back home.
And as I was on the front porch looking at my pockets, I realized I didn't have the keys.
In fact, I could see the window that they were on the dining table where it was <unk>
So quickly I tried to open all the other doors and windows, and they were all pretty hot.
I thought to call a <unk> at least I had my cell phone, but at midnight, a <unk> could take a lot of time in there, and it was cold.
I couldn't go home from my friend of Jeff to spend night because I had an early flight to Europe next to the next morning, and I was <unk> from my passport and my suitcase.
<unk> expensive, but it's sure that not more expensive than a <unk> at night, so I thought, despite the circumstances, in the room very well.
I'm a profession and I know a little bit about how the brain works under stress.
<unk> <unk> that increases heart rate increases, by the mood of adrenaline and <unk> the thinking.
And when I came to the <unk> <unk> at the airport, I realized I didn't have my passport.
Well, I had a lot of time to think about those eight hours without sleeping.
And I started to ask myself, if there was something I could do, and I could put it in his place, and I knew bad things happen.
Or at least if you happen, bad things, which is the likelihood that it's a total catastrophe happen.
So I started thinking about that, but until a month later, my thoughts didn't exist.
I was having dinner with my colleague Danny <unk> winner of the Nobel Prize, and a little embarrassed told him that I broke the window, and that he had forgotten my passport, and Danny shared with me that I had been practicing something called hindsight <unk>
It's something that he had learned from the psychologist Gary <unk> who had written about this a few years earlier, known as the <unk>
You all know what the <unk> is.
Every time there is a disaster, a team of experts come out and try to figure out what it came wrong, right?
In the <unk> like <unk> you look forward and tries to figure out all the things that you could go wrong, then try to figure out what can do to prevent things to happen or to minimize the damage.
So what I want to talk to you about is some things that we can do in the form of a <unk>
Some of them are <unk> others are not so <unk>
I'm going to start with the obvious.
At the house, you have a place for the things that you lose easily.
This sounds like common and it is, but there's a lot of science that supports this <unk> based on how our space memory works.
There is a structure in the brain called hippocampus, which has evolved over thousands of years, to track the location of the important things, where the fish are, where the fish are, that places the trees -- where the tribes live and <unk>
The hippocampus is the part of the brain that <unk> in the <unk> of London.
It's the part of the brain that enables the <unk> to find their nuts.
And if you ask if someone really did the experiment, they cut the <unk> meaning of the <unk> and they could still find their nuts.
They were not using smell, but the hippocampus, that very evolved mechanism of the brain to find things.
But it's really good for things that don't move much, not so good for things that move very much.
This is the reason to lose keys on the car, reading and <unk>
So at home <unk> a place for the keys, a hook next to the door, maybe a dish.
For their passport, a particular drawer for it.
For their reading reading a particular <unk>
If you take a place and they are <unk> with that, you will always be there when the <unk>
What about <unk>
Take the cell phone a picture of your credit card license card to drive, passport, please give it for mail to be in the cloud.
If these things lose or <unk> it can make the <unk>
These are some of the most obvious things.
Remember, when you're standing under stress, your brain releases <unk>
<unk> is toxic and <unk> the thinking.
So some of the <unk> practice is to recognize that under stress will not be at the best time, and you have to put the systems on the site.
And there is perhaps not even more stressful situation than when you face a medical decision.
And at some point, we will all be in that situation, to have to make a very important decision about the future of our medical care or to be dear to help them with a decision.
And so I want to talk about that.
And to talk about a very particular medical condition.
But this is <unk> as a <unk> for all forms of medical decisions, and in fact for the decision-making and social decisions and social decisions, any kind of decision that you have to take away from that would benefit an rational assessment of the facts.
So suppose you go to the doctor and the doctor says, "I've got the result of the lab and cholesterol is a little <unk>
You all know that high cholesterol is associated with a higher risk of heart disease, heart <unk>
So you're thinking that having the high cholesterol is not the best, then the doctor says, "I'd like to give you a drug that will help you reduce the <unk> a <unk>
And you may have heard about the <unk> and you know that it's one of the most passionate drugs in the world today, even you are likely to know people who are <unk>
So you would say, "Yes, <unk> <unk>
But there's a question that you must do then, a statistic that you have to ask for the most doctors don't want to talk, and drug companies even less.
It's for the <unk> the number needs to treat.
What is this, the <unk>
It's the number of people who have to take a drug or to have surgery in any medical procedure before you can help one person.
And you must think about what kind of statistical statistic is <unk>
The number must be one.
My doctor didn't tell me anything if I wasn't to help me.
But actually, the medical practice doesn't work like this.
And it's not the doctor of the doctor, and if it's to be <unk> it's about scientists like me.
We have not understood very well the <unk> mechanisms.
But the estimates of <unk> that 90 percent of drugs works only about 30 percent of the people.
So the number needs to treat the most widely <unk> which believe it is?
How many people do you have to take it before you could help someone person?
300.
This is the research of the blind researchers -- <unk> <unk> and Pamela <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
I would explore the numbers.
300 people have to take the drug for a year before avoiding a heart attack, or another <unk> event.
Now maybe you think, "Well, one probability in 300 of my <unk>
Why not? <unk> <unk> the recipe for all <unk>
But then you have to ask for a more statistical statistic and it's <unk> of the <unk> effects, right?
For this particular drug, the side effects are produced by five percent of patients.
And those include things that are <unk> muscle pain and <unk> pain <unk> but they're thinking, "The five percent is not very likely to go to me, still take the <unk>
But a moment.
Remember that under stress don't think clearly.
So think about how you do this with time, so you don't have to make the chain of reasoning on the act.
300 people take the drug, right? A person has been <unk> five percent of the 300 has side effects, that are 15 people.
You have 15 times more likely to get rid of the <unk> for the drug that drug help you help you.
I don't say that they should not take the <unk>
I just say you must have this conversation with your doctor.
Digital ethic is also part of the beginning of informed consent principle.
We have right to have access to this kind of information to start the conversation about if you want to take the risks or not.
You may be thinking that I've launched this number in the air for the value of the crash, but actually this number needs to be pretty typical.
To the surgery that most is done in the older men in the age of 1950s, <unk> of prostate cancer, the number needs to deal with is <unk>
That's how it is, 49 surgeries for a person who has helped to happen.
And the side effects in that case are produced by 50 percent of patients.
Those include <unk> or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
And if you are lucky and it's one of that 50 percent of the effects of just a year or two.
So the idea of <unk> is to think before the questions that you can make the conversation forward.
You don't have to make all this stuff on the act.
And they also want to think about the quality of life.
Because you have a great option, they want a <unk> life of pain, or a longer life that could have much pain at the end?
These are the things that they speak and think about now, with their family and their loved ones.
They can change in the heat of the moment, but at least you're trained in this kind of thinking.
Remember, our brain releases <unk> under stress, and one of the things that happens at that moment is that you turn a lot of systems.
There's an evolutionary reason for this.
Face to face with a predatory system, you don't need the <unk> system or the <unk> or the immune system, because if the body is spending the metabolism in those things, doesn't react very quickly. They could get lunch lunch -- so none of it matters.
Unfortunately, one of the things that is going on the window during those moments of stress is the rational thought like Danny <unk> and his colleagues have shown.
So we need to think about the future to this kind of situations.
I think the important thing here is to recognize that we're all <unk>
We're all going to fail in time.
The idea is to think of the future how those <unk> are going to put the systems in the place that will help to minimize harm or to prevent the bad things in the first place.
He went on to the night of <unk> in <unk> when I came back from my journey, my contractor installed a combination of combination next to the door, with a key door to the entry door, a easy way to remember it.
And I have to admit that I still have a lot of cards that I haven't ordered and lots of messages that I haven't seen.
So I'm not very organized, but I see the organization as a <unk> process, and I'm doing it.
Thank you very much.
Interpreter: This is my favorite favorite symbol of mine.
It means <unk> <unk>
If you're playing a musical instrument, and you see a <unk> on the <unk> you need to touch more <unk>
Two <unk> even more gentle.
Four <unk> extremely gentle.
This is my drawing of a tree of <unk> there you see that it doesn't matter how many thousands and thousands of <unk> can never come to a complete silence.
That's my current definition of <unk> a very dark sound.
I would like to share a little bit about the history of the American system, the signs, <unk> in addition to a little bit of my own story.
The French signs came over in the 1950s, and over the time of time, I mixed with local laughter, and developed the language that we know as <unk>
So it has a story about 200 years.
I was born <unk> and I was taught to believe that sound was not a part of my life.
And I thought it was true.
However, I now realize that it's not true for nothing.
The sounds are a very important part of my life, really are in my mind every day.
As a <unk> person who lives in a computer world, it's like I lived in a foreign country, following a foreign country, following their rules, and they would have <unk> and rules and <unk>
So how do I understand the audio <unk>
Well, I see how people behave and respond to sound.
People are like my speakers and <unk> the sound.
<unk> and <unk> that behavior.
At the same time, I've learned that I can create sound, and I've seen how people <unk>
So I've learned for example.
"Not <unk> <unk>
"Don't do a lot of noise in the eating of <unk> <unk>
"Not <unk> and when you're eating, make sure not <unk> <unk> <unk>
I call this <unk> <unk>
Maybe I think about the sound tag more than the average person does it.
I'm super <unk> of the sounds.
And I'm always waiting with <unk> the sound, about the coming next.
From there, this drawing.
<unk> by decide.
Let's try and keep going.
<unk> for <unk>
You can see that <unk> has no notes on the lines.
That's because the lines already contain sounds across the <unk> subtle <unk>
In the culture, the movement is equivalent to the sound.
This is the signal for <unk> in <unk>
A typical <unk> has five lines.
However, to me, to be with my thumb that it doesn't feel natural.
That's why in my drawings I just have four lines on the paper.
In 2008, I had the opportunity to travel to Berlin, Germany, for an artistic residence there.
Before this time, I had worked like <unk>
During this summer, I visited museums and spaces of different <unk> and while I went from one place to another, I realized that there was no visual art there.
At that time, the sound was the trend and that called me the <unk>
There was no visual art, everything was hearing.
Now sound has entered my art art.
Is it going to get me more about art?
I realized it doesn't have to be like this.
In fact, I know the sound.
I know it so well that it's not just experiences through the ears.
I can feel it <unk> or I can experience visually, or even as an idea.
So I decided to reclaim the sound of sound and focus on my artistic practice.
And everything that had taught me as a sound, I decided to leave it and <unk>
I started to create a new job.
And when I presented it to the art community, I was <unk> with the amount of support and attention that I had.
And I realized that sound is like money, the power, the social currency <unk>
At the bottom of my mind, I always felt the sound was <unk> it was a <unk> person.
And the sound is so powerful that it could be taken to me and my artistic work, or I could be able to get it away.
I chose to get it away.
There's a massive culture around the language of speech.
And only because I use my literal voice to communicate, the eyes of society is like I didn't have a voice at all.
So I have to work with people who can support me like it and become my voice.
So I'm able to be relevant in today's society.
So in school, in the work and institutions, work with many different performers from <unk>
And his voice becomes my voice and identity.
They help me be <unk>
And their voices have value and weight.
Ironically, by asking for <unk> their voices, I'm able to maintain a temporary form of value something like taking a loan with a very high rate.
If you're not going to continue with this practice, I feel that I could be able to focus on <unk> and not have any kind of social value.
So with the sound like my new artistic medium <unk> in the world of music.
And I was amazed at seeing the similarities between music and <unk>
For example, a musical note cannot capture and express fully <unk>
And the same thing can be said in <unk>
Two are very <unk> and highly <unk> which means that subtle changes can affect all the meaning as much as the signals like the sounds.
I'd like to share with you a metaphor for the piano, so you understand better how the <unk> works.
So, imagine a piano.
<unk> split up in many different parameters, <unk>
If you're <unk> a different <unk> for each finger as the facial expression -- the movement of the body, the movement of the body, the shape of the hand and so while the piano, the English is a linear language, as if it was <unk> just a button at once.
However, <unk> is more like a <unk> you need the 10 fingers in the way to express a concept of clear or idea of <unk>
If only a key <unk> would create <unk> it creates a completely different meaning of it.
The same thing happens with the music in the pitch, <unk> and volume.
In <unk> when we use these different parameters, parameters, you can express different ideas.
For example, the <unk> signal in that."
This is the <unk> signal in that."
I'm looking at you.
<unk> <unk>
Oh, <unk>
<unk> oh.
What are you <unk>
Ah, <unk>
So I started thinking, and if I see <unk> through the lenses of music?
So if I had to create a sign and you put it over and again, it could be like a piece of visual music.
So for example, this is the <unk> sign of the sun is going to go and put it up.
This is all the day."
If you look at it, and you see the visually speed, visually looks like a piece of music.
The whole day.
I feel like the same thing can be said to do tonight."
All tonight."
This is all night, in this drawing.
And this led me to think about three different types of <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>  Get tonight."
I feel like the third has more <unk> than the other two.
This represents how time is expressed time in <unk> and how the distance to the body can express changes in time.
For example, one <unk> is a hand, two <unk> is two hands, the present gets closer and in front of the body, the future is in front of the body and the past is on the back.
So the first example is <unk> a lot of time."
Then, <unk> <unk> <unk> and the last one, which is my favorite, with a very romantic and dramatic idea at the same time, <unk> one again."
<unk> <unk> is a musical term with a <unk> rate of <unk>
However, when I see the word <unk> <unk> I think automatically in <unk> same time."
Look at <unk> hand right -- <unk> left hand.
We have the <unk> through the head and the chest.
<unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Can you do it with me?
All of the hands at high.
Now we're going to do it both in your head as his chest, something like <unk> <unk> or <unk>
Yes, pretty well.
That means <unk> in the international system.
The international system, as a note, is a visual tool to help communicate in all cultures and the languages of signs worldwide.
The second I'd like to show you is this -- please do it with me again.
And now this.
It means <unk> in <unk>
Now, third. Let's go back again.
And over again.
It's <unk> in <unk>
Let's do three together.
<unk> <unk> and <unk>
Good job.
Look at how three signs are very similar. Everybody occur in your head and the chest but they transmit very different.
It's amazing to see how the <unk> is alive and wealthy as the music.
However, today, we live in a very troubled world.
And just because the <unk> doesn't have any social value.
We need to start to question what defines social value and allow them to develop their own value, without sounds.
And this could be a step to make a more inclusive society.
And maybe people will understand that you don't have to be deaf to learn how to <unk> and don't have to hear about learning music.
<unk> is a rich trove of drought, and I'd like you to have the same experience.
I'd like to invite you to open your ears to open your eyes, to participate in our culture, and experience from our visual language.
And you never know, you can even fall in love with us.
Thank you.
<unk> <unk> Hey, that's me.
As a child, my parents would say, "Can you get rid of everything, but then you have to <unk>
Freedom involves responsibility.
But my imagination took me to all these wonderful places, where everything was possible.
So I grew up in a bubble of innocence or a bubble of ignorance I must say, because adults would lie to us to protect us from the horrible truth.
When I get older, I learned that adults also <unk> and they're not very good for cleaning the other people.
The country, now I'm a adult and I teach citizen and invention in the <unk> school of Hong Kong.
You don't have to wait a lot for my students to walk across the beach <unk> with lots of waste.
So as good citizens, clean up the <unk> and no, it's not drinking alcohol, and if you are, I don't get it.
It's sad to say, but more than 80 percent of the oceans are plastic.
It's kind of <unk>
And in the last few decades, we've been coming out with these great ship and networks, to collect those pieces of plastic and to study them under the microscope, and the <unk> and <unk> this information on a map.
But it takes an eternity and it's very expensive and it's also very expensive to use those enormous <unk>
So along with my students, with ages six to 15 years, we dreamed of making a better way.
We've transformed our tiny classroom in Hong Kong in a workshop.
We started building this <unk> <unk> <unk> so that the very <unk> children can also participate.
And I'll tell you, kids who manipulate electrical tools feel cool and safe.
Not exactly.
Let's go back into plastic.
We collect plastic and reduce the size that we find it in the ocean, which is very small, because of their <unk>
That we do.
I leave it to the imagination of my students.
My job is to try to take the best ideas from every child and try to get it into something that we hope it will work.
We decided that instead of collecting pieces of plastic, only <unk> information.
By using a robot, we take a picture of this <unk> the children get a lot of a little bit with the robots.
Then we created what we call "a <unk>
We're so fast.
And we can turn the lights and cameras on your web and <unk> it in a floating robot that will move slowly through the water and the plastic that we have there, and this is the picture of the robot.
We see the bits of plastic in plastic in the sensor while the computer on board process this image and measure the size of every particle, to get a estimate of how much plastic in the water.
<unk> this invention on a website for inventors called <unk> with the hope that someone else would get it even more.
The great thing about this project is that students saw a local problem, and <unk> are trying to figure out immediately.
<unk> research on my problem -- but my students in Hong Kong are kids very well <unk>
You see the news news, you get the Internet, and you get rid of this <unk>
A child, maybe less than 10 years, cleaning a oil spill, just using the hands, in <unk> the largest <unk> rainforest in Bangladesh.
They were very shocked because this is the water that <unk> is the water in which the water <unk> where the place where they live.
You can also see that the water is brown, and the oil is also brown and when everything is <unk> it's very difficult to see what it is in the water.
But there is a simple technology called <unk> which allows you to see what's in the water.
We built a very first prototype of a <unk> which can be <unk> through all kinds of substances that produce different spectra that can help identify what is in the water.
We took this prototype with a sensor and we send it to Bangladesh.
The great thing about this project is that beyond solving a local problem, or about analyzing a local problem, my students used their empathy and their sense of creativity to help in the other children.
I was forced to figure out a problem to <unk> I was forced to make a second experiment, and I wanted to go a little bit further, maybe to address a more difficult problem, and also closer to me.
I'm half an Japanese half and French half and maybe remember, in 2011, there was a devastating earthquake in Japan.
It was so violent that it took several giant waves called <unk> and those <unk> 90 cities on the coast of Japan.
More than 14,000 people died in a second.
It also gives the nuclear energy plant from Fukushima, a nuclear power plant close to water.
And today, according to the reports on 300 tons is still <unk> of the nuclear plant in the Pacific Ocean.
Today, the entire Pacific Ocean has traces of pollution by <unk>
If we go to the west coast, we can measure radiation radiation everywhere.
But if you look at the map, it seems that most of the radiation disappeared from the <unk> coast -- and most of the time, it has a safe, it's blue.
Well, the reality is a little bit more complicated than that.
I've returned to <unk> every year from the accident and researching a independently with other scientists, the land, the river, and this time we wanted to take the kids.
Of course not <unk> the parents didn't get it.
But every night we went to the center of <unk> here you see the use of different masks here.
It might seem like they didn't take the work seriously, but they did it because they are going to have to live with the <unk> all their life.
Together with them we discussed the data <unk> that day and we talk about what we were going to do next, and strategies, and so on.
And to do this, we created a <unk> map of the region around the nuclear power plant.
We created the map of <unk> introduced <unk> to represent real-time data in the real time of <unk> and <unk> water to simulate the rain.
And so we were able to notice that the radioactive dust is <unk> from the top of the mountain toward the <unk> system and <unk> in the ocean.
It was a <unk>
But based on this we organize an civil expedition -- the closest to nuclear power to date.
We are approaching a half miles of nuclear use, and with the <unk> help of the area we were collecting sediments from the sea bed with a tracking tracking tracking thing as we invented and built.
Here we see a <unk> we've gone from a local problem to a remote problem to a global problem.
And it's been very exciting to work on these different scales, also with open-source technologies and very simple.
But at the same time, it's increasingly been more and more frustrating because we've only been starting to measure the damage that we've done.
We've not even begun to try and solve problems.
I wonder if we should give the jump, and try to invent better ways of doing all these things.
So the classroom became so small so much, we found an industrial facility in Hong Kong and we turned it into the largest space dedicated to social and environmental impact.
It's in the heart of Hong Kong and it's a place where we can work with wood, metal chemistry, a little bit of biology -- basically, you can build almost everything there.
It's also a place where adults and children can play together.
It's a place where the dreams of children can actually become with adults, and where adults can be children again.
Students: <unk> <unk>
<unk> <unk> We asked things like, we can invent the future of mobility with renewable energy?
For example.
Or we can help in movement from the advanced age transforming their standard wheelchair chairs into new <unk> vehicles.
The plastic, the oil and the <unk> are <unk> terrible, but the worst legacy we can leave our children are <unk>
We cannot afford to protect the children of the horrible truth because we need their imagination to invent the solutions.
So, citizens scientists, creators, <unk> we have to make the next generation for the environment, and the people, and so that can actually do something about it.
Thank you.
Two <unk> <unk> two radically opposite design.
One is made of thousands of pieces of pieces of steel -- the other one of a silk dragline
One of them is synthetic the other one.
One is the <unk> of the environment, the other thing he did.
One is designed by nature, the other one of it.
Michelangelo said that when he looked at the <unk> <unk> he saw a figure that struggle for being free.
The <unk> was only a tool of <unk>
But living things are not <unk>
They grow up.
And in the smallest units of life, the cells, we took all the information that was required by every cell to work and to <unk>
The tools also have consequences.
At least since the Industrial Revolution, the design world has been dominated by <unk> of the manufacturing and production of mass.
The assembly lines, a world made out of the world made out of the world, <unk> the imagination of designers and architects to think about their objects like <unk> <unk> with different functions.
But you don't find <unk> of material material in nature.
Think about human skin, for example.
Our facial skins is thin <unk>
The skins of the shoulders are <unk> with little <unk>
One is mainly as a filter is mainly like barrier, and yet it's the same <unk> there is no <unk> there's no <unk>
It's a system that vary gradually its functionality through the variation.
So here's a divided screen, which represents the <unk> <unk> personality of every designer and architect to work now between the <unk> and the gene, to work on the machine, and the organism between the assembly and the growth, between Henry Ford and Charles Darwin.
These two visions of the world, my left hemisphere and right, and that's a synthesis, it shows up in the two screens after me.
My work, at the simplest level, it's about bringing these two views in the world, moving from the assembly and coming into growth.
You probably wonder, why now?
Why wasn't it possible about 10 or even five years?
We live in a very special moment in history, a rare moment, where we had four disciplines that offer designers to tools that we had never had access to before.
And at the intersection of these four fields, my team and I believe it.
Please know the minds and the hands of my students.
We designed objects, products, structures and tools at all through the <unk> <unk> like this robotic arm with a <unk> basis that some day not very far away to print <unk> buildings and graphics to the nanoscale facts of genetically altered that shine out in the dark.
So here we have <unk> the <unk> an archetype of the ancient Arab architecture, and has created a screen where every aperture is <unk> to shape the shape of light and heat through it.
In our next project, we explored the possibility of creating a layer and a <unk> this was for a fashion <unk> of Paris with <unk> they're <unk> It's like a second skin made of one piece, <unk> in the <unk> flexible <unk>
Along with 3D printing collaborator we print this layer and <unk> 3D <unk> between the cells -- I'll show you more objects like that.
This helmet is combining rigid and soft materials in the resolution of 20 <unk>
This is the resolution of a human hair.
It's also the resolution of an MRI scanner as well.
That designers have access to this intense resolution analytical and the instruments that allow them to design products that are made, not only the way of our bodies, but the physiological structure of our tissues.
We've also designed a acoustic chair a chair at time as comfortable as comfortable and as well as they absorb sound.
The Carter teacher, my collaborator, we went back to the nature of <unk> and by designing this pattern of surface <unk> it becomes <unk>
It turns out this surface of 44 different properties, which vary in <unk> <unk> and color, <unk> to the pressure points in the human body.
His surface, like in nature, vary its functionality not by addition to another material or another <unk> but <unk> continuously and <unk> the material property.
But it's the <unk> nature.
There's no parts in nature?
I was not raised in a religious home, but when I was young, my grandmother told me stories about the Bible <unk> and one of them was left and found a lot of what I care about.
As she said, "In the third day of the <unk> God sends on the Earth to grow a tree -- loaded with <unk>
For that first tree <unk> there would be no difference between the trunk, so leaves and <unk>
The whole tree was a <unk>
Instead, the land did grow trees with branches, <unk> <unk>
The Earth created a world made of parts.
I often ask, "What would design if objects were made by a single ride.
You would have a better state of the <unk>
So we looked for the <unk> material, the kind of material of the tree <unk> with fruit and we found it.
The second <unk> more abundant on the planet is called <unk> and about 100 million tons that are produced by organisms.
We thought if we could tune in their <unk> we could generate structures in a single piece.
So that's what we did.
We call it <unk> <unk>  We asked a lot of <unk> <unk> <unk> and produced <unk>
We took the chemical concentrations -- we've been able to achieve a wide range of <unk> from dark, hard and <unk> to the light, soft and transparent.
To print the large-scale structures that built a system with multiple <unk> <unk> <unk>
The robot could vary the properties of the material on the way and create these structures made out of a single material -- three feet long, 100 percent recycled.
When the pieces are ready, they let them dry it into it to find a natural form of contact with the air.
So why do we keep designing <unk>
The air bubbles that were a byproduct of the printing process was used to contain <unk> <unk> which was for the first time on the planet three billion years ago, like we heard yesterday.
Along with our collaborators at Harvard and MIT, <unk> the bacteria designed to capture rapidly carbon from the atmosphere and make it in sugar.
For the first time, we've been able to generate structures that make their transition without problems of <unk> to mesh, and if it broadens even windows.
A tree <unk> <unk>
Working with an ancient material, one of the first forms of life on the planet, with abundant water and a little bit of synthetic biology, we have transformed a structure made of shrimp husks in an architecture that behaves like a tree.
And here is the best part: for things that are designed for <unk> in the sea, <unk> life <unk> and placed in the ground, they will grow a tree.
<unk> for our next exploration design principles was the solar system.
We're looking for the possibility of creating clothes to keep the life for <unk>
To do that, we have to dominate the bacteria and control their flow.
So like the <unk> board, we made our own table of elements: new forms of life created <unk> made of <unk> made of <unk> <unk>
I like to think of synthetic biology like the liquid <unk> only that instead of <unk> metals -- they were <unk> new biological <unk> within very small channels.
This field is called <unk>
<unk> our own 3D channels to control the flow of these crops.
In our first piece of clothing, it's <unk> two <unk>
The first is <unk>
It lives in our oceans, and in the ponds of fresh water.
And second, E. <unk> the bacteria that live in the human intestine.
One turns to the light in sugar, the other consumed sugar and produces the <unk> of useful environment.
But these two <unk> don't interact in nature.
In fact, they never got <unk>
They're here, designed for the first time, to have a relationship in a piece of clothes.
Think of it as evolution, not by natural selection, but evolution by design.
To contain these relationships, we've created a single channel that looks like the Lazarus tract tract that will help you make these bacteria and to make it their function of way.
And so we started to grow up those channels in the human body, including the properties of material according to the functionality of the material.
If we wanted more <unk> <unk> channels more transparent.
This is a hormone <unk> system, when you get to one end to each other, it is 60 meters.
This is half the length of a soccer field, and 10 times more than our very very gut intestine as well.
And here it is, like <unk> at TED, our first <unk> <unk> channels very bright in your clothes.
Thank you.
Mary <unk> said, "We are past <unk> creatures, only half is <unk>
What if designing the other <unk>
And if we could create structures that increase matter <unk>
And if we could create personal <unk> that <unk> our skin, the tissue or <unk> our <unk>
Think of this as a way to edit biology.
I call this the material ecology.
To do it, you always have to go back to nature.
So for now, you know that a 3D printer, is that printing material <unk>
You also know that nature doesn't do this.
<unk> <unk> with <unk>
This cocoon of <unk> for example, creates a highly sophisticated architecture, a home inside which is <unk>
<unk> <unk> is about this level of <unk>
It does it through the combination of two materials, but of two protein in different <unk>
One acts like structure, the other is the glue or the matrix, <unk> those fibers in each other.
And this happens across scales.
The silk worm first goes into the environment, creates a <unk> structure, and then it starts to <unk> a cocoon of compression.
The tension and the <unk> the two forces of life, manifest themselves in one material.
In order to understand better how this complex process works, we attach a little magnet to the head of a silk worm to the <unk>
We put it into a box with robotic sensors, and that allowed us to create this cloud of points in three dimensions and visualizing the complex architecture of the cocoon of the silk worm.
However, when we put the silk worm in a flat patch -- not within a box, we realized that it was <unk> a cocoon and still <unk> <unk>
So we started designing different <unk> different <unk> and we've found that the shape of the <unk> structure is transmitted directly by the environment.
You often have <unk> the silk worms to death within their <unk> and the silk is <unk> and it's used in the <unk> industry.
We saw that designing these templates we could make a way to <unk> silk without boiling a single <unk>
It was <unk> and we could create these things.
So we have this process to the architectural scale.
We had a robot <unk> making <unk> and we put it into our site.
We knew that silk worms are <unk> to most dark and clear areas that we use a solar route to reveal the distribution of light and heat into our structure.
So we created holes or <unk> to block the rays of light and heat down, and it will break the silk worms over the structure.
We were ready to get the <unk>
We asked <unk> worms from a silk farm online.
And after <unk> four weeks, they were ready for us.
We put them very carefully on the bottom edge of the <unk> and as they <unk> <unk> they put eggs, and life starts again, like us, but much, much more short.
<unk> Fuller said that tension is the great integrity, and he was right.
When we were <unk> biological silk on <unk> silk, <unk> -- they give all this pavilion its integrity.
And in little more than two or three weeks, you know, <unk> silk worms are <unk>
In a curious symmetry, this is also the length of the silk route.
The <unk> after the <unk> produce 1.5 million eggs.
This could be used for 250 additional <unk> in the future.
So here are the two visions in the world.
A silk <unk> through a robotic arm, the other fills empty.
If the last frontier of design is to give life to the products and the buildings that surround us, to form a two material ecology -- designers must bring these two views in the world.
Which brings us back, of course, in the beginning.
Here's a new era of design, a new era of creation, that brings us from a inspired design in nature to a nature inspired by the very first time, which demands for us, for the first time, we make ourselves charge of nature.
Thank you.
Thank you very much. Thank you.
Hands up if you ever ask them, "What do you want to be <unk>
If you had to remember what age they had when they asked them for the first time.
You can <unk> it with toes.
Three. Five. Three.
Now, raise your hand if the question you want to be <unk>
It has caused them some kind of anxiety.
Any anxiety.
I'm someone who could never answer the question, "What do you want to be <unk>
The problem wasn't that I didn't have any interest, but I had <unk>
At the school I liked the English, the <unk> and the art and the art and the art and then went to websites and then played the guitar on a punk band called <unk> <unk>
You may have heard of us.
And in general I like to test and persist anyway, for having spent a lot of time and energy and sometimes money in this field.
But with time this feeling of <unk> this feeling of, it's no longer a challenge, it comes to <unk>
And I have to give it up.
But then I was excited about something else, which is totally different, and I get rid of it, and I am going to absorb and feel <unk> I've found the <unk> and then again this point where I start <unk>
And finally, I want to give it up.
But then I'd like to figure out something new and different, and I would like to go into that.
This pattern caused me a lot of anxiety, for two reasons.
The first was because I wasn't sure how I was going to turn all this into a career.
I thought I had to choose one thing, denying all my other passions, and <unk> <unk>
Another reason that it caused me so anxiety was a little more personal.
I was worried that there was something wrong with this, and something wrong with me is not going to get out of anything wrong.
I was concerned to have a fear of commitment, or to be dispersed, or in my own success.
If you can relate my story and these feelings, I would like to ask you something I'd like to have raised me then.
<unk> themselves, where they learned to allocate the meaning of wrong or abnormal to do things.
I'm going to tell you where they did -- they learned from culture.
You ask first what do you want to be <unk>
When we have about five years.
And the truth is that nobody cares about what I was talking about.
This is considered a naive question to cause cute answers in children like, <unk> <unk> or <unk> <unk> or "I want to be <unk>
You know, <unk> <unk> here.
This question is over and again as we grow in different ways, <unk> <unk> to high school students are asked to pick up in college.
And at some point, what do you want to be <unk>
It's going to be the cute exercise of being the cute exercise before what the dream.
Why?
If this question is inspired by children to dream with what they might be, I won't dream with everything that might be.
In fact, it does just the opposite.
You have to <unk>
This is Dr. Bob <unk>  -- and he's <unk> and <unk>
And this Amy <unk> publisher he turned into <unk> <unk> and a creative <unk>
But most kids don't hear about people like this.
All you hear is that they are going to have to choose.
But it's more than that.
The notion of life is very <unk> in our culture.
It's this idea of fate or the real calling of the idea that each of us has something to spend during their time on this land, and you have to figure out what that thing is and devote their life to it.
But if you're not connected to this way?
What if there are a lot of different themes that wake up your curiosity and lots of different things that you want to do?
There's no place for someone in that framework.
And so you can feel alone.
You can feel that it doesn't have a goal.
And feeling there is something wrong with one.
There's nothing wrong with you.
It's a <unk>
A <unk> is someone with many interests and creative activities.
It's a breath, to say.
It could help if you divide up in three parts: a <unk> and <unk>
You can also use other terms that you can use the same idea, like <unk> <unk>
For the time of the Renaissance, the ideal was who I was <unk> in multiple disciplines.
Barbara <unk> refers to us as a <unk>
<unk> any term you like or <unk> your own.
It seems like a kind of adapt to a community, we cannot agree with one identity.
It's easy to see <unk> like limitation or woe that you must win.
But what I've learned about talking to people and writing about these ideas on my website, is that there is huge strengths in being this way.
Here are three superpowers <unk>
One: <unk> of ideas.
I mean, the combination of two or more fields and creating something new in the <unk>
<unk> <unk> and Rachel <unk> <unk> their shared interests in cartography, visualization of data, and travel, mathematics and design, when I found <unk>
<unk> is a company that creates jewelry <unk> <unk>
And <unk> and Rachel came up with this unique idea for its <unk> mix of skills and experiences.
Innovation is happening at intersections.
And that's where new ideas come from.
And the <unk> with all their background, can access a lot of these points of <unk>
The second superpower, <unk> is very quickly.
When we <unk> we are interested in something, let's get it.
We looked at everything we can have in our hands.
We're used to being <unk> because of having been <unk> in the past, and this means that we have less afraid to test new things and get out of our comfort.
A lot of skills are <unk> to other disciplines, and we bring everything we've learned to every new zone that we <unk> so we rarely start from zero.
<unk> <unk> is a full-time <unk> and an independent writer <unk>
As a child pianist was an amazing ability to develop muscle memory.
Now, she's the faster <unk>
Before becoming a writer, he was <unk> financial <unk>
He had to learn the most fine sales mechanics when he was starting with of them, and this ability to write a compelling <unk> for the editors
They rarely have a loss of time to go to what you would get to, even if you finally get it to the end of it.
It is possible to apply that knowledge in a completely different field, in a way that you couldn't have <unk>
The third superpower <unk> is adaptability. It's the ability to turn into anything you need in a <unk> situation.
<unk> <unk> is sometimes director of the videos, other designer designer, sometimes consultant of Kickstarter, sometimes teacher, and sometimes apparently, James <unk>
It's valuable because it does a good job.
He's even more valuable because it can take different roles depending on the needs of your clients.
<unk> Company defines adaptability as the most important ability for development, to thrive in the 21st century.
The economic world changes as quickly and <unk> that are the individuals and organizations that can be able to meet the market needs, which really <unk>
<unk> of ideas, quickly learning and <unk> three abilities where <unk> are very <unk> and three skills that could be lost if you're a pressure to reduce their targets.
As a society, we have a great interest in encouraging <unk> to be themselves.
We have complex problems, <unk> right now, and we need creative thinkers.
Let's say they are, in your heart, specialists.
<unk> of the belly knowing because they wanted to be <unk> <unk>
Don't worry, there's nothing wrong with you.
In fact, some of the best equipment is made up of a specialist and a <unk> <unk>
The specialist can dive into depth and put in practice, and the <unk> offers a amplitude of knowledge to the project.
It's a beautiful relationship.
But we should all design lives and careers that are going to interact with how we are connected.
Unfortunately, the <unk> in a large part of them are told to be more like their <unk>
I once said this, if there is one thing you can take from this talk, I hope it's this: <unk> with inner wiring is whatever.
If you are a heart, then, <unk> all media.
That's where you will give the best of itself.
But for the <unk> in the room, including those who just give up to be one of them in the last 12 minutes --  I say, <unk> it with his lots of passions.
Follow his curiosity for those <unk> <unk>
<unk> the intersections.
<unk> our inner wiring leads to a more authentic and happy life.
And perhaps most importantly, <unk> the world is <unk>
Thank you.
In the year we had a woman called <unk> they brought it to a psychiatric <unk>
<unk> <unk> and I couldn't remember even the most basic details of their life.
His doctor was <unk>
<unk> I didn't know how to help <unk> but <unk> for her until unfortunately, passed away in <unk>
After their death, <unk> did a <unk> and they found weird plates and <unk> in the <unk> brain, of a guy who had never seen before.
The even more surprising.
If you had been living today, we could not give her more help that he <unk> gave him <unk> years ago.
<unk> was Dr. <unk> Alzheimer's.
And <unk> <unk> the first patient to receive a diagnosis that we now call disease disease.
From <unk> medicine has advanced a lot.
You have discovered antibiotics and vaccines to protect us from infections, so many treatments for cancer cancer, for HIV, <unk> for <unk> and much more.
But it's been made up in the treatment of Alzheimer's.
I'm part of a team of scientists who work to find a cure for Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade.
So I think about this all the time.
Alzheimers now affects 40 million around the world.
But by 2050, it will affect 150 million that, by the way, will include many of you.
If you expect to live until 85 years or more, the possibility of Alzheimer's will be almost one in two.
In other words, there is the likelihood that they spend their teenage years with Alzheimer's or helping take care of a friend or be dear to Alzheimer's.
In the U.S., the drug care costs 200 billion dollars every year.
One of five dollars of medical care is spent on disease.
Today it's the most expensive disease and its <unk> costs, an increase in five times in 2050, as the generation of the <unk> boom.
It may surprise you, but Alzheimer's is one of the greatest social and social challenges of our generation.
But it's done relatively little for <unk>
Today, one of the first 10 causes of death from all over the world, Alzheimer's is the only one you can't afford to cure or even slow their development.
We understand less than Alzheimer's than other diseases because we've invested less time and money in the research.
The U.S. government spends 10 times more every year in cancer research than Alzheimer's disease despite the fact that it costs us more than Alzheimer's and causes a similar number of deaths like cancer.
The lack of resources is due to a more fundamental cause, the lack of consciousness.
Because this is what little people know, but all the <unk> <unk> is a disease, and we can <unk>
For most of the last few years, all of all, all of us, even, scientists, Alzheimer's disease with aging.
We think that will be <unk> in a normal and inevitable part of aging.
But you only have to look a picture of a brain aged healthy compared to an Alzheimer's patient to see the real physical damage caused by this disease.
In addition to unleash a severe memory of memory and mental skills, the damage to the brain caused by Alzheimer's reduce dramatically life expectancy and it's always deadly.
Remember, Dr. Alzheimer's I found plates and <unk> strange in the <unk> brain, a century ago.
For almost a century, we didn't know much about this.
Today we know that they're made of protein molecules.
You can think of a protein molecule like a piece of paper that folds as a origami.
There are places in the paper that are <unk>
And when it folds right, these <unk> dots end up inside.
But sometimes things go wrong, and some <unk> dots stay on the outside.
This makes the protein molecules <unk> each other, forming groups that can form large plates and <unk>
That's what we see in the brain of patients with Alzheimer's.
We've spent the last 10 years at Cambridge University trying to understand how this <unk> works.
There's a lot of steps, and the identification of what step step is complex, like <unk> a bomb.
You put a wire could do anything.
<unk> others can make the bomb bomb.
You have to find the right step that it does, and then create a drug that does it.
Until recently, in its most of the wires have reduced the wires and expected the best.
But now there is a diverse group of people, doctors, biologists, nurses, <unk> physical, engineers and mathematicians.
And together, we've managed to identify a critical step in the process. It's now testing a new kind of drugs that block specifically this step to stop disease.
Let me show you some of our last results.
No one outside our lab has seen it yet.
Let's look at some videos from what happened when we test these drugs in <unk>
These are the <unk> and you can see that they move with normal.
These maggots, on the other hand, have protein molecules that are placed in each other within them, as in humans with Alzheimer's.
And you can see that they're clearly sick.
But by giving our new drugs to these worms at an early stages, then we see that <unk> and live a normal life.
This is just an initial result of positive, but research as this shows that Alzheimer's is a disease that we can understand and cure.
After <unk> years of wait, there's real hope of what can be achieved in the next 10 or 20 years.
But to grow that hope, to overcome Alzheimer's disease, we need help.
It's not about scientists like me, this is about you.
We have to make sure that Alzheimer's is a disease and that if we can do it, we can <unk>
In the case of other diseases, and the patients and their families have printed more research and <unk> pressure upon governments, pharmaceutical and <unk>
That was essential to get HIV in the late 1980s.
Today we see that same unit to overcome cancer.
But Alzheimer's patients often can't speak for themselves.
And their families, the hidden victims of their loved ones day and night, are often too <unk> to go out and advocate for change.
So it really depends on you.
Alzheimer's is, in most cases a genetic disease.
Everybody with a brain run the risk.
Today, there are 40 million patients like <unk> that can't create the change that they need for themselves.
<unk> talking for them, and help to demand a cure.
Thank you.
I published this article in the New York Times <unk> in January of this year.
To fall in love with someone, it does this.
The article is a psychological study, designed to create romantic love in the lab, and from my own experience to prove it itself one night last summer.
So the procedure is quite simple: Two strangers are <unk> to get 36 questions, and then you both look at the eyes without talking about four minutes.
Here's a couple of questions of example.
Number one: If you could wake up tomorrow with a quality or ability, which would be?
Number one: When was the last time you get another person in front of someone else's person?
And <unk>
<unk> <unk> these are increasingly personal.
Number two: <unk> really <unk> me to your partner what you like to her, or she -- I know very honest this time, and I gave things that you don't say to someone you've ever met.
And when I came across this study a few years ago, a very detail really struck me, the gadget that two of the participants had married six months later, and invited all the lab to the ceremony.
So, it was <unk> about this process of making romantic love, but of course, it was also <unk>
And when I had the opportunity to test this study, with someone I knew not particularly good, I didn't expect to <unk>
But I thought it was a good story, so I would send it to the column on my Love -- they were a few months later.
That was published in January, and now it's already <unk> so I guess some of you are probably asking them, keep together <unk>
And the reason I think this is because I have done this question over and over the last seven months.
And this question is just what I want to talk about today.
But let's go back to it.
A week before the paper was <unk> was very nervous.
I had been working on a romantic book in the last few years, so I had asked me to write about my experience in romantic love in my blog.
But a blog entry can come to a few hundred views like a lot, and those were usually just my Facebook friends and imagined that my article in the New York Times will see a few thousands of views.
And that came a good burden of attention in a relatively new relationship.
But as I had had no idea.
The article was published on a Friday night at night, and I had the Saturday, this happened in the traffic of my blog.
And Sunday, the Sunday already had been called <unk> Show and "Good <unk> <unk>
In a month, the article received over eight million views, and I was like, by saying something, little prepared for this kind of attention.
One thing is to foster the trust writing by writing that is that the loving life of one has been international news --  -- and the people around the world are really interested in the state of your new relationship.
And when people call it or <unk> what they did every day for weeks, they always did the same question: still together?
In fact, when I was preparing this talk, I made a quick search on the mailbox of my email with the phrase: <unk> still <unk>
And several messages came back immediately.
They were students and journalists and strange <unk> like this.
I was interviewed in the radio and <unk>
Even, I gave a talk, and a woman screamed at the stage, "Hey <unk> where is your <unk>
And I immediately got red.
I understand that this is part of the deal.
If you write about your relationship in an international journal, you should expect people to feel comfortable and ask about it.
But I wasn't prepared for the wingspan of the response.
The 36 questions seemed to have <unk> life.
In fact, the New York Times posted a <unk> article for San <unk> who included the experience of readers by proving the study in them with different degrees of success.
So my first impulse to all this attention was very <unk> with my own relationship.
I said not to every petition that we both did a public line together.
I had a television interviews, and <unk> the orders of people from us two.
I think I was afraid to become the <unk> <unk> of the <unk> process, a range of that I didn't feel at all.
And I understand that people didn't want to know only if the study worked -- they wanted to know if it was able to produce love, not just an adventure, but not just an adventure, but real, love <unk>
But this was a question I didn't feel able to respond.
My relationship was just a few months, and I felt about everything, that people made the wrong question.
How do you know if we put it together or not, and also <unk>
If the answer was no, I would make the experience of making these 36 questions less interesting?
Dr. Arthur <unk> wrote first about these questions in this same study in 1997. And there, the goal of the researcher was not producing romantic love.
Instead of doing that, I was looking for interpersonal <unk> between college students, using what they <unk> called <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk>
Sounds romantic, right?
But the study worked.
The participants felt closest to doing so much more close after doing so many later studies, they also used to be able to have a <unk> protocol to create trust and interaction between strangers.
They have been used between the members of the police and the community, and they've used it among people from opposite policy.
The original version of the story, which I tried last summer, which combines personal questions with four personal contact, was cited in this article, but unfortunately, it never <unk>
A few months ago, I was giving a talk at a small liberal arts university, and then a student came to me and said to me with <unk> I tried the studio and didn't work.
He looked like <unk>
I said, "Well, you want to tell you the person who you do it.
Well he did a pause.
I think she just wants us to be friends.
And I said, "But they got better friends?
They were able to get better to know better after proving the <unk>
<unk>
So, I said, "I said.
But I don't think that was the answer that he was looking for.
In fact, I don't think it's the answer that neither of you is looking for when it's about love.
I came across the study for the first time when I was 29 percent, and I was going through a really hard one.
I had that relationship since I had 20, what was supposed to have all my adult life, and he was my first true love and I had no idea how or if I could live without it.
So I'm going to get rid of science.
I did everything I could find on the science of romantic love, and I expected that that could be <unk> the heart.
I don't know if I realized this at the time I thought I just went to the book that I was writing but in hindsight, it seems to be really <unk>
I thought that if I was fascinated with the knowledge of romantic love, I would never have to feel as bad and I used to feel like I was then.
And all this knowledge has been useful in a different way.
I'm more patient with love. I'm more <unk>
I have more confidence in requiring what I'm after.
But I can also see me more clearly and I can realize that what I look for is sometimes more than reasonably than reasonably as you can demand for me.
What I'm looking for the love is a <unk> not just being <unk> and being <unk> tomorrow, but I will still be beloved indefinitely by the person I love.
It may be the guarantee that people asked when they wanted to know if we were still together.
The story that the media told about 36 questions is that there may be a shortcut to <unk>
There may be a way to somehow mitigate some of the <unk> risk -- and this is a very troubled story, because in love we make us feel beautifully, but it's also terrifying.
But I think when it comes to love, we're very willing to accept the short version of the story.
The version of the story is, still still together?
And their content with a response of Yes or No.
So more than a question, I would argue that let's make some more difficult questions, questions like, how do you decide who deserves your love and who doesn't?
How are you going to be in love when things are <unk> and how to know when to cut and <unk>
How do you live with the uncertainty that inevitably leads to a relationship?
I don't know the answers to these questions, but I think they are a good start to have a <unk> conversation about what means to love someone.
So, if you want the brief version of the history of my relationship, it's <unk> a year ago, a known and I applied a study designed to create romantic love, we have <unk> we still keep together, and I'm very <unk>
But in love is not the same thing to remain <unk>
<unk> is the easy part.
So at the end of my article <unk> the love didn't happen.
<unk> in love because we took the choice to be.
And I <unk> a little bit of reading it now, not because it wasn't true, but because at the moment, there was not considered everything that I was supposed to do.
He didn't think of how many times we would have both to take that decision, and how much I will have to keep doing that choice without knowing before if he always chose or not.
I want you to be enough to have done and responded 36 questions, and I have chosen to love someone as generous, kind and fun and expressed that choice in the largest daily newspaper in the United States.
But what I've done, instead is turning my relationship into the kind of myth that I don't really believe.
And what we're going to do, and what I might have spent my life looking for is that that myth is true.
I want the happy ending implicit in the title of my paper, which is, by the way, the only part of the article that I didn't know.
But what I have in change is the opportunity to choose to love someone, and the hope that he also love, and it's <unk> but that's the deal with love.
Thank you.
I was raised by a little lesbian out of the mountain and sort of came out as a <unk> of the forest.
The city of New York does a time.  One thing that really affected me but more details later.
I'll start with when I was eight years old.
It took a wood box and <unk> a dollar, a dollar, a pen and a fork in her somewhere in Colorado.
And I thought that some strange <unk> or a few aliens would find this box about 500 years later and <unk> how our species <unk> ideas, for example, how do we eat <unk>
I had no idea.
But anyway, it has grace because here I am, 30 years later, and I'm still doing boxes.
At one point, I was in <unk> <unk> like going from <unk> and <unk> and all of those things <unk> and I was making a collage for my mother.
And I took a dictionary and I took all the pages and I took a sort of <unk> <unk> to the style Agnes Martin, the covered of resin and a bee was <unk>
Well, my mother has fear of bees and it's <unk> to them, so I added a more resin on the canvas, I think I could <unk>
Instead, the opposite: it happened the opposite: somehow it looked like it grew up, as if it was that they would get the text with a <unk>
So I did <unk> I built more boxes.
This time, I started to add electronic elements, frogs strange bottles that was finding out the road, all that I could find, because I was looking for things all my life, trying to <unk> and tell stories about these objects.
So I started drawing around the objects, and I realized that God can draw in space.
I can flow <unk> drawing like it does about a body in the crime scene.
And I took the objects and I created my own taxonomy of individuals that were born.
First of all, <unk> of the ones that you can do an idea.
Then I did some insects and weird creatures.
It was very fun to draw on the <unk> layers.
And it was great, because I started building exhibitions and those things, and I was making some money, to bring my girlfriend for dinner, for example, to go to <unk>
It was great man.
At some point I was interested in the human form, sculptures of the <unk> of natural beings with pictures of human beings inside layers.
It was great, except for one thing: I was <unk>
I didn't know what to do, because the <unk> was going to kill me.
And I was going to bed every night thinking about it.
So I tried to use glass.
I started drawing on the glass layers, similar to the drawing in a window, and then another window window, and he had all these windows together that made a three-dimensional composition together.
And this really worked, and so I could stop using the <unk>
So I did this for years, and my work <unk> with something very big, I call <unk>
For the <unk> inspired me in the <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> which is a painting at the Museum of the <unk> in Spain.
Do you know?
Well, it's a fantastic picture.
They say it's a little bit ahead of your time.
Well, the <unk> <unk> this piece.
It weighs 11 pounds.
5.5 meters long.
It has double face, so it's 10 meters of composition.
It's a little bit rare.
Well, that's the source of blood.
On the left, is Jesus and <unk>
There's a cave where all these creatures with heads of animals travel between two worlds.
You're from the world of representation, to this <unk> <unk> <unk>
Here is where creatures with heads of animals are headed to <unk> lists for suicide <unk> in the ocean.
The ocean is comprised of thousands of elements.
This is a bird god tied to a <unk>
Billy Graham is in the <unk> <unk> -- the <unk> platform of Osama bin Laden, there are all kinds of strange things that you can find if you look very well in the ocean.
But anyway, also a kind of <unk>
It's coming out of the ocean, and it spits out oil in a hand while the other hand is coming out of the other hand and the other hand is clouds.
Their hands are like <unk> and it looks like a <unk> that holds the Earth and the cosmos in balance.
So it's one aspect of the <unk>
It's a little story.
That's the hand in which we <unk>
And then, when you go on the other hand, it has a <unk> like a bird, and it spits out the clouds of this <unk>
It also has a five-year tail, a <unk> tail that joins the <unk>
But anyway, its tail set up to the <unk> on a <unk>
I don't know why it was.
Things that go, you know.
His tail ends up in a eyeball of <unk> made of 1986.
You've got <unk>
They were made in the 1980s, as if they were baseball baseball cards.
Very <unk> at their time.  This brings me to my last project.
I'm in the middle of two <unk> One is called <unk>
This is a <unk> project to make 100 of these human beings.
Each one is an archive of our culture, through media and material that is <unk> dictionaries or magazines.
But each one acts as a kind of a form of a human, and they travel in groups of 20, four or 12 at the time.
They're like cells, they come together, divide it up.
And you can walk between them. It's getting years.
Each one is basically a microscope <unk> which weighs 1.3 pounds of a human being caught inside.
This has a little cave in the chest.
That's the <unk> it's the chest, the <unk> can be <unk>
I will see you for the rest of the body -- there's a waterfall that comes out of the chest, and it covers you a penis or <unk> or whatever you have, a kind of <unk> thing.
It's a quick photograph of these works because I can't afford it for a long time.
We have layers, you can see them.
This is a body in half.
This has two heads -- and it's communicating between the two.
There are some pills that come out and go into the head of this strange statue here.
There's a little forest scene inside of <unk> <unk>
Can you <unk>
Anyway, this talk is about these <unk> just like the boxes that we live in.
We're in a box, the solar system is a box.
This brings me to my last box.
It's a <unk> It's called <unk> <unk>
In this box there is a physicist -- a neuroscientist, a musician, a musician, a <unk> a writer, a <unk> a museum, a school, a <unk> publishing arm that spreads all the content that we do in the world and a garden.
It goes down the box and all the people in it hits each other like particles.
And I think that's the way to change the world.
When you have a <unk> who is and the box that's living in.
And together we came to realize that we're all together in this, that this illusion that we are different, these concepts of countries, from the borders, of religion, does not work.
We're all very made of the same matter and the same box.
And if we don't start trading those things with sweet and <unk> we're all going to die very soon.
Thank you very much.
What do you do when they hurts your head?
They take a <unk>
But for this pill to have an effect against pain, first happens by the stomach, the guts and other organs.
I'll take a pill is the most effective and <unk> system for any drug to make it effect on the body.
<unk> though, is that the <unk> any drug <unk>
And this is a big problem, especially in patients with HIV.
When you take <unk> drugs that are <unk> to decrease the amount of virus in blood, and to increase the brain account.
But they are also known for their side effects <unk> in their negative, because in time that it takes to get to the current stream -- they would be absorbed and worse even for the time that it takes to get to their destiny, which is where it is most important, in the HIV store.
These are regions of the body like the lymph of the nervous system, the nervous system, where the virus is <unk> and in the bloodstream.
However, after the treatment, the virus can wake up and infect new stem cells.
This is the big problem of HIV treatment with the current drugs that is a treatment of life running through the oral <unk>
One day, I sat down and I thought, "You know, making the treatment directly into the warehouse of virus, without the risk of <unk> of <unk>
As a scientist in <unk> the answer was in front of me, <unk> of course.
If you use it in <unk> for the care of wounds and surgery and diabetes -- can be used for any single thing, including transportation of drug <unk>
In fact, we're using laser pulses to open or drill <unk> extremely small holes, which open and closed, almost immediately the cells infected with HIV to introduce the medicines.
The best thing is, "How is that <unk>
We sent a little bit of a laser and powerful laser on the cell membrane living by HIV while these cells are embedded in a liquid that contains the drug.
The laser travels through the cell, while the cell absorbs the drug in a matter of microseconds.
Before you even realize it, the hole is <unk> immediately.
We're testing this technology in vitro or <unk> <unk> but the goal is to bring this technology into the human body, apply it to the human body.
"How is that <unk> you can ask.
Well, the answer is, through a device in three heads.
With the first head, which is our laser, we're going to do a <unk> at the place of infection.
The second head, which is a camera, is going to be the place of infection.
Finally, the third head, a <unk> that distributes the drug, it releases directly into the site of infection, while the laser is used again to keep the cells open.
Well, this doesn't seem to be a lot of time.
But one day, if it's successful, this technology can lead to the total eradication of HIV in the body.
Yeah. A cure for HIV.
This is the dream of every researcher of <unk> in our case, a laser treatment.
Thank you.
In the last decade, I've looked at armed groups -- not <unk> organizations like terrorists, insurgents or <unk>
<unk> what these groups do when they're not shoot themselves.
My goal is to understand the best of these violence drivers and study ways to encourage violent participation to violent <unk>
I do work work, in the world of politics and the library.
Understanding these groups is key to solving almost entirely conflict in course, because the war has changed.
It used to be a dispute between states.
Not anymore.
Now it's a conflict between states and actors and non-state actors.
For example, the <unk> arrangements of peace deals with 1975 and 2011, <unk> had signed up between a state and a non-governmental actor.
So we have to understand these <unk> we have even been <unk> or <unk> in any process of successful conflict.
But how do we do that?
We need to know what motivates these organizations.
We know very well the reasons why you can do it, but nobody analyzes what they do when they don't exist.
The armed struggle and the <unk> policies are <unk>
It's all part of the same organization.
We cannot understand these groups, not much less <unk> without a global worldview.
<unk> are complex organizations.
For example, the <unk> <unk> known for their violent <unk> against Israel.
From their creation in the 1980s, <unk> has also established political game, a network of social services and a military system.
In the same way, the Palestinian <unk> known for their suicide attacks against Israel, also runs the <unk> of Gaza since 2007.
So these groups do more than simply shooting.
They're multitasking guys.
We had a complex machinery of <unk> radio stations channels channels channels and websites on the social networking thing.
And here you have the printed <unk> magazine in English and published it for <unk>
Their armed groups also invest in a complex fundraising.
These activities are key.
They allow these groups to increase their strength, increase their funds, to recruit their brand.
Those armed groups also do something else: they create stronger ties with their population by investing in social services.
They build schools, run hospitals, they put professional training programs or <unk> programs.
<unk> offers all these services and more.
Those armed groups are also trying to conquer the population by offering something that the state is not <unk> security and protection.
The rise of the Taliban in a Afghanistan were torn by the war, or even the rise of the rise of <unk> it can also be able to look at the efforts of these groups to provide security.
Unfortunately, in these cases, security has a price 325 to the population.
But in general, providing social services means filling up a vacuum, a <unk> gap by government, and allow these groups to strengthen and increase their power.
For example, the election victory of 2006 from Palestinian Hamas cannot be able to recognize the social work of the group.
It's a really complex scenario in the West, when we look at the <unk> groups, we just think about the violent side.
But that's not enough to understand the strengths of these groups, the strategy or the long-term vision.
These groups are <unk>
<unk> because they fill gaps in the government, and they emerge like armed and political groups, engage in violent struggle and give governance.
And the more complex and more sophisticated ones are these organizations, we can be <unk> as opposed to a state.
How do we call a group like <unk>
<unk> part of a territory, we run all their <unk> they collect the garbage, they run the <unk> system.
It's a state? It's a <unk>
Or maybe it's something else, new and different.
And what is <unk>
<unk> <unk>
We live in a world of states, of nations without state and hybrids and the weaker ones are the states, like in the Middle East and the most <unk> and they fill that gap the non-state actors.
This is important for governments, because to counter these groups will have to invest more than not military tools.
We have that empty gap of government has to be at the center of any sustainable approach.
This is very important to establish and turning the peace.
If we understand better school groups, we will understand better what incentives to foster the transition from violence to violence.
In this new dispute between states and actors -- not <unk> military power can earn some <unk> but not giving us peace and stability.
In order to achieve these goals we need long-term investments to fill that security vacuum to fill that security gap that allowed these groups to thrive in a beginning.
Thank you.
I'm a failure as a feminist and a feminist.
My opinions about gender equality is <unk> but I'm afraid that accepting openly the label of <unk> would be unfair for <unk>
I'm <unk> but pretty bad.
And therefore I became a bad feminist.
Or at least I wrote an article and a book called "The <unk> <unk> and then in interviews, people started to call me <unk> <unk>
So what started as a personal joke meant to me and a <unk> <unk> has become a bigger thing.
Let me give you a step back.
When I was young, especially in my youth and the 20 years old, I had strange ideas about the <unk> these women <unk> <unk> with men and <unk> sex. Like if that was a bad thing.
Today, I see what women are treated in the world and anger, in particular, seems like a perfectly reasonable response.
But at the time, I was worried about the tone that I was using people to <unk> that might be a feminist.
It's going to be labeled as a feminist was a <unk> which is a taboo word.
I was struck as a woman who doesn't follow the rules, which calls too much, with high self-esteem and <unk> to believe that it's equal to a man.
No one wants to be that woman <unk> until you realize that actually is that woman and you can't imagine being another person.
Over time, as I was growing up, I started to accept that I am, actually, <unk> and also proud to be.
For me, certain claims are <unk> women are equal to men.
You know, the same wages for the same work.
We have the right to travel around the world as <unk> or violence.
We have the right to use very easy and accessible <unk> and services.
We have the right to decide about our bodies, no need for <unk> <unk> or doctrines <unk>
We have the right to respect.
There's more.
When you talk about the needs of women, you have to have in account our other <unk>
We're not only women.
We are people with a different body, expression of gender, religion and <unk> social condition and so much more.
We need to have in account these differences and how we relate to the same way that it matters what we have in common.
Without this kind of <unk> our feminism is nothing.
For me, these truths are <unk> but to be clear, I'm a disaster.
I'm full of contradictions.
There's a lot of things that make me a bad feminist.
I have another confession.
When I get to work, I hear rap music in volume.
Although the letter <unk> to the women and I was struck by the classic <unk> <unk> of the Yin yang -- is amazing.
You can actually get your t-shirt.
<unk> <unk> <unk> until you hit the <unk>
Think about it.
<unk> poetry, right?
I'm completely <unk> by my musical music.
I firmly believe in the work of man, which is all I don't want to do, <unk> -- all the <unk> <unk> but also killing insects, the collection of junk -- the <unk> <unk> and maintenance <unk>
I don't want to have anything to do with that.
<unk> is my favorite color.
<unk> of the fashion magazines and the nice things.
I can see "The <unk> and the <unk> <unk> and I have erotic fantasies of the <unk> fairy fairy tales, they make a reality.
Some of my crimes are more <unk>
If a woman wants to take the name of his husband, it's his election, and I'm not <unk>
If a woman decides to stay home to raise their children, I accepted that choice, as well.
The problem is that it becomes economically vulnerable to this same election, the problem is that our society is <unk> so that the women are <unk> so that women are <unk>
We would have this problem.
<unk> the conventional feminism has been ignored or <unk> historically the needs of color women, the gay and gay workers, gay women and <unk> in favor of white, <unk> <unk>
If that's good feminism is a very bad feminist here.
It also happens the following: As a feminist, I feel a lot of pressure.
We have this tendency to put <unk> <unk> in a <unk>
We hope it will be <unk>
When we were <unk> we take a lot of taste of the same <unk> where the <unk>
As I said, I'm a <unk> I am a <unk> of that <unk> before you try to put myself there.
<unk> women, particularly innovative and leaders of sector, are afraid to be <unk> like <unk>
They are afraid to stand up and say, "Yeah, I'm <unk> for fear of what that tag is for fear of fear not being able to fulfill little realistic.
Let's take for example, or like I call it, <unk>
In the last few years is a feminist <unk>
In the <unk> Music of 2014, in <unk> <unk> in front of the word <unk> <unk>
It was a <unk> show, looking at this star of poop embrace openly about feminism and to know women and young men that will be feminist is something to be proud of.
<unk> the time, the cultural critics began endless debates when they were <unk> it was or not exactly a feminist.
<unk> their feminism, instead of just believing the word of an adult woman and <unk>
<unk> perfection of the <unk> because we're still struggling for a lot, we want a lot, we need so much <unk>
We are very much more beyond sensible criticism and <unk> to get rid of any woman, <unk> until it is nothing to be there.
We don't need to do that.
<unk> or rather, an feminism is the point of <unk>
But what happens next?
We went to recognize our <unk> to give the action and be a little bit more brave.
If I listen to music music, I'm creating a demand for artists that would be more happy to give a supply supply.
These artists won't change their way to talk about women in their songs until they understand the change effectively affecting their profits.
It's certainly hard.
Why does his music have to be so <unk>
It's hard to choose something better and so easy to justify a better choice.
But when the bad decisions justify this makes it more difficult for women to achieve equality, equality that we all deserve and is our responsibility.
I think of my <unk> <unk>
It's two <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> and also very brave. I want to grow up in a world.
It is where they were told by the strong creatures that are.
And I think of them, all of a sudden, the best choice is to be used as something much easier to do.
We can all make better decisions.
We can change the canal when a television program deals with sexual violence against women as sport, <unk> the <unk>
We can change the radio drone when we hear songs that treat women like nothing.
We can spend our money to go to cinema in another part when movies do not treat women more than like <unk> objects.
We can stop supporting the professional sports where athletes treat their classmates like <unk>
In any case, the men, especially white men can say, "No, I'm not going to post in your magazine, engaging in your project, or work with you, until it doesn't have a number of enough women, so much to participate as to make decisions.
I'm not going to work with you until your <unk> or your organization is more <unk> with a broader range of people."
Those of us who are <unk> but <unk> to participate in this kind of projects, we can also focus it to be even more like us to be <unk> to overcome barriers to decisions.
Because we're not <unk> <unk> Without these efforts, without embracing these <unk> our achievements is very little.
We can make these small acts of courage and hope that our decisions will come to the top, to the people in the power of the <unk> and the music, <unk> the <unk> the people who can make great decisions, more courageous, to create a durable and significant change.
We can also tell the courage of our feminism, good, bad, or from any <unk>
The last line of my book <unk> <unk> says, <unk> will be a bad feminist not being <unk>
This is true because of a lot of reasons, but I tell you, most of all, because the ancient man, my voice was to come to me and Feminism was helped me <unk>
There was one incident.
I call it an incident to deal with what happened.
A few guys told me when I was very young, and I didn't know that kids can do this to a girl.
I treated me as if it was nothing.
I started believing it wasn't nothing.
I got my voice, and after all of you didn't tell me to believe that I could say something that could matter.
But I was writing.
And with it went back to <unk>
I was <unk> in a stronger version of myself.
The words of those women who could understand a story like mine, and the women who looked like me and they understood what meant to live in this world if you have the brown skin.
I read the words of women who showed me that was nothing.
I learned to write like them, and then I learned to write like myself.
I found my voice again, and I started believing my voice is powerful beyond what you can measure.
And I also found that if I was a little brave, another woman could be <unk> and see me and realize that none of us is the world that the world is trying to tell us that we are.
In one hand, I have the power to achieve anything.
And on the other, I have the <unk> reality.
I'm a bad feminist, I'm a good woman, I'm a good woman, I'm trying to improve my way to think, what I do, without abandoning everything that makes me human.
I hope we can all do the same thing.
I hope that we can all be a little bit courageous, when you need such a <unk>
Right after Christmas of last year, I heard children in California had <unk> to have visited <unk> or being exposed to someone who had been there.
The virus then went through the border with Canada, <unk> over 100 children in <unk>
One of the <unk> things about this outbreak is that the <unk> that may be lousy for a child with an immune system, is one of the most easily infectious diseases in the world.
There is an effective vaccine against this for more than half a century ago, but many of the kids involved in the <unk> outbreak had not been vaccinated because their parents were afraid of something allegedly <unk> autism.
But a moment, it wasn't the article that unleashed on autism and vaccines <unk> <unk> and marked by being a <unk> fraud by the British Medical Medical
It doesn't believe most of the smart scientists that vaccines cause autism is a <unk>
I think most of you know, but millions of parents all over the world are still <unk> that vaccines put in danger to their children of having autism.
Why?
Here's why.
This is a graph of the estimates of the increase of autism in time.
For most of the 20th century, autism was considered a very rare disease.
The few psychologists and pediatricians who had heard about it, creating all his professional life without seeing one case.
For decades, the estimates of prevalence continued stable just three or four children per 100,000.
But then, in the 1990s, the numbers started <unk>
<unk> of fundraising.
What's going on?
If you're not vaccines, what is it?
If you ask people about the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta -- what's going on, tend to be based on phrases like <unk> <unk> and a better detection detection to explain these <unk> figures.
But that kind of language is not <unk> a lot of the fears of a young mother looking for the face of his son of two years, the visual contact.
If the diagnosis of diagnosing you had to figure out why they were so <unk>
Why were the case of autism as hard to find before the <unk>
Five years ago, I decided to figure out the answers to these questions.
I learned that what happened has less to do with slow progress and <unk> of science that with the benefits of storytelling.
For most of the 20th century, doctors told a story about what autism, and how it was discovered, but that story turned out to be fake, and the consequences of the same is having an devastating impact on global public health.
There was a second more accurate story of autism that had lost and forgotten in the dark corners of the clinical literature.
This second story tells us everything about how we get here and where we need to go.
The first story starts with a child psychiatrist -- Leo <unk> at Johns Hopkins Hopkins <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> who looked like <unk> private worlds -- <unk> people around them, even their own parents.
They could have fun during hours by waving their hands on their face, but they were <unk> the panic for <unk> like when he didn't put their favorite toy in their usual place without knowing them.
On the base of the patients treated in their clinic, <unk> <unk> that autism is very rare.
For the decade of 1950, as the main authority of the world is stated that I had seen less than 150 true true cases of their syndrome while <unk> references from places as far as South Africa.
This is actually not surprisingly, because the criteria of <unk> for autism diagnosis was very <unk>
For example, let's give that diagnosis to children with <unk> but we now know that epilepsy is very common in autism.
Once it was <unk> that he had turned nine from every 10 children to go to their doctor's office for being autistic without giving them a diagnosis of autism.
<unk> was a smart, but part of his theories were not <unk>
<unk> autism as a form of child and child is caused by cold parents and <unk>
These kids, he said, they've kept me very carefully in a refrigerator that doesn't exist.
At the same time, though, I noticed that some of his young patients had special skills that cluster them in certain areas like music, mathematics and memory.
One of the kids in their clinic could distinguish between 18 -- before the age of two years.
When his mother put one of his favorite records, he said, <unk>
But <unk> had a bad opinion of these skills, stating things like the children were simply <unk> what they had heard their parents <unk> desperate to win their approval for.
As a result, autism became a source of shame for families, and two generations of autistic children were sent to institutions for their own good, becoming invisible for the world in general.
Amazingly, it wasn't until the 1970s that researchers started to test the <unk> theory that autism was weird.
<unk> <unk> a psychologist, <unk> psychologist in London, thought that the theory of mothers from <unk> was pretty stupid.
She and her husband was warm and warm, and they had a deep autistic daughter called <unk>
<unk> and John knew how hard it was to raise a girl like <unk> without special education, and no access to other resources without a diagnosis.
To stand for the National Minister of Health that they needed more resources for autistic children and their families, and their colleague, Judith Gould decided to do something that there should be done 30 years before.
They launched a study of HIV prevalence in the general population.
It was a suburb of London called <unk> to try to find the autistic children in the community.
What you saw was that the <unk> model was too limited, because the reality of autism was much more transparent and diverse and diverse and diverse ones.
Some kids couldn't speak at all, while others were <unk> in their fascination in astrophysics, in dinosaurs or in the genealogy of <unk>
In another way, these kids don't <unk> in nice <unk> and <unk> like <unk> and they saw a lot of them, much more than the <unk> model of <unk> would have predicted.
At first, they were lost to try and make sense of their data.
How no one didn't realize these kids before?
But then <unk> found a reference to an article published in <unk> the next year to the article in <unk> and then he was <unk> buried under the ashes of a terrible time that nobody wanted to remember.
<unk> knew about this article of competition, but I avoided <unk> <unk> in his own work.
There was not even a translation of the English, but luckily, the <unk> husband was German -- and he did it for her.
The document gives an alternative story of autism.
His author was a man named Hans <unk> who was leading an integrated clinic with a school in Vienna, in the 1930s.
<unk> ideas for the teaching of children with learning differences were <unk> even for <unk> standards.
The morning in their clinic started with music exercises with music, and kids kept their games on Sunday afternoon.
Instead of blaming the parents of causing autism, as described as the <unk> <unk> of life that required <unk> and <unk> spaces in the course of all life.
Instead of treating kids in their clinic as patients, who called them their little teachers, and he was devoted to helping in the development of education methods that were particularly suited for them.
And yet, what is what is what a diverse diverse diverse <unk> is a staggering variety of cancers, and disability.
He believed that autism and autistic traits were common and always been, watching this continuum of this continuum in <unk> known in pop culture like the awkward social scientist and Professor <unk>
He was beyond even to say, that for success in science and art, a hint of autism is critical.
<unk> and Judith found that <unk> was wrong when autism was <unk> as well as parents were the <unk>
Over the next few years, they worked in silence with the American Association of <unk> to expand the criteria of the diagnosis of what they called the diversity of what they called <unk> <unk>
In the late 1980s and principles of the '90s, their changes came into <unk> by the limited model of <unk> for a broad and inclusive.
These changes didn't fall in the broken debris.
<unk> when <unk> and Judith worked between <unk> to reform these <unk> people around the world see an autistic adult for the first time.
Before I came out of <unk> <unk> in 1988, just a little circle, <unk> by experts knew what autism, but after the <unk> performance of <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> with four <unk> of <unk> <unk> psychologists and parents around the world knew what the autism was.
At the same time, the first clinical trials were introduced to use to diagnose autism.
I didn't have to have a connection with that little circle of experts to get a diagnosis for his son.
The combination of <unk> <unk> the changes in the criteria and the introduction of these tests created a net effect, a perfect storm of the consciousness of autism.
The number of diagnoses started to <unk> the same as they predicted <unk> and they were actually hoping that it went, so that the people with autism and their families will finally get their support and services that are <unk>
So Andrew <unk> came to blame vaccines for the increase in the <unk> and a simple <unk> and <unk> credible history as bad as the <unk> theory that autism was <unk>
If the current model of preventing the prevention center, that one in <unk> children in the United States are right in the spectrum, is right, the <unk> are one of the world's largest groups in the world.
In the last few years, people have joined the Internet to reject the idea that they are the puzzles for the new medical advances -- <unk> the term <unk> to celebrate the varieties of human cognition.
One way to understand <unk> is to think of terms of a human operating system.
The fact that a PC works with Windows doesn't mean it's <unk>
According to the <unk> <unk> the normal human brain is easily <unk> social <unk> and it suffers from a deficit deficit to detail.
<unk> people have hard to live in a world not built for them.
70 years later, we're still reaching <unk> which believed that <unk> for the most <unk> aspects of autism are found in the understanding of teachers, employers with capacity, of capacity, of ability, and the parents with faith in the potential of their children.
A autistic woman named <unk> <unk> once said, "We need all the hands on cover to <unk> the <unk>
While we went to an uncertain future, we need all the forms of human intelligence on the planet to address the challenges that we face as a society.
We can't afford to waste a brain.
Thank you.
